Despite this abundance, only prima facie evidence as to its efficiency and power to significantly change behavior has been offered. That is, little empirical data have been available to guide the design, development, and implementation of level systems. This article presents a chronicle of the development of level systems and examines assumptions underlying their concepts and components. The discussion leads to a set of recommendations to help guide future research into the design and implementation of level systems. }

	abstract = { Autistics are presumed to be characterized by cognitive impairment, and their cognitive strengths (e.g., in Block Design performance) are frequently interpreted as low-level by-products of high-level deficits, not as direct manifestations of intelligence. Recent attempts to identify the neuroanatomical and neurofunctional signature of autism have been positioned on this universal, but untested, assumption. We therefore assessed a broad sample of 38 autistic children on the preeminent test of fluid intelligence, Raven's Progressive Matrices. Their scores were, on average, 30 percentile points, and in some cases more than 70 percentile points, higher than their scores on the Wechsler scales of intelligence. Typically developing control children showed no such discrepancy, and a similar contrast was observed when a sample of autistic adults was compared with a sample of nonautistic adults. We conclude that intelligence has been underestimated in autistics. }
