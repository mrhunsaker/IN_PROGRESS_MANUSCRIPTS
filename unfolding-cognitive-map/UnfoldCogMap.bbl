      \field{abstract}{Bilateral damage in the posterior cingulate region can induce anterograde amnesia. Identifying the potential contributions of the various areas within this heterogeneous region has, however, largely depended on animal research. Within the posterior cingulate region the retrosplenial cortex stands out by virtue of its dense interconnections with the hippocampal formation and anterior thalamic nuclei. Consistent with these connections is the finding from lesion studies in animals that the retrosplenial cortex is necessary for navigation and spatial learning, and that these functions occur in close conjunction with the hippocampal formation and anterior thalamus. Suggested functions include the creation and maintenance of scenes, linked to the switching between scenes based on different frameworks (e.g. egocentric versus allocentric). More fine-grain analyses suggest that there are functional distinctions between the subregions within the retrosplenial cortex, though these subregions are likely to then act as a coordinated unit. Other studies reveal that the retrosplenial cortex is highly sensitive to damage in distal sites, including damage to sites that do not have direct retrosplenial connections. The resultant retrosplenial dysfunctions, which include decreases in metabolic activity and a loss of plasticity, may contribute both to diencephalic and temporal lobe amnesias as well as to Alzheimer's disease.}

      \field{abstract}{This review charts recent advances from a variety of disciplines that create a new perspective on why the multiple hippocampal-anterior thalamic interconnections are together vital for human episodic memory and rodent event memory. Evidence has emerged for the existence of a series of parallel temporal-diencephalic pathways that function in a reciprocal manner, both directly and indirectly, between the hippocampal formation and the anterior thalamic nuclei. These extended pathways also involve the mammillary bodies, the retrosplenial cortex and parts of the prefrontal cortex. Recent neuropsychological findings reveal the disproportionate importance of these hippocampal-anterior thalamic systems for recollective rather than familiarity-based recognition, while anatomical studies highlight the precise manner in which information streams are kept separate but can also converge at key points within these pathways. These latter findings are developed further by electrophysiological stimulation studies showing how the properties of the direct hippocampal-anterior thalamic projections are often opposed by the indirect hippocampal projections via the mammillary bodies to the thalamus. Just as these hippocampal-anterior thalamic interactions reflect an interdependent system, so it is also the case that pathology in one of the component sites within this system can induce dysfunctional changes to distal sites both directly and indirectly across the system. Such distal effects challenge more traditional views of neuropathology as they reveal how extensive covert pathology might accompany localised overt pathology, and so impair memory.}

      \field{abstract}{The dentate gyrus in the hippocampus is one of two brain regions with lifelong neurogenesis in mammals. Despite an increasing amount of information about the characteristics of the newborn granule cells, the specific contribution of their robust generation to memory formation by the hippocampus remains unclear. We describe here a possible role that this population of young granule cells may have in the formation of temporal associations in memory. Neurogenesis is a continuous process; the newborn population is only composed of the same cells for a short period of time. As time passes, the young neurons mature or die and others are born, gradually changing the identity of this young population. We discuss the possibility that one cognitive impact of this gradually changing population on hippocampal memory formation is the formation of the temporal clusters of long-term episodic memories seen in some human psychological studies.}

      \field{abstract}{It has been proposed that spatial relations are encoded either categorically, such that the relative positions of objects are defined in prepositional terms; or in terms of visual coordinates, such that the precise distances between objects are represented. In humans, it has been assumed that a left hemisphere neural network subserves categorical representations, and that coordinate representations are right lateralised. However, evidence in support of this distinction has been garnered exclusively from tasks that involved static, two-dimensional (2D) arrays. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify neural circuits underlying categorical and coordinate representations during active spatial navigation. Activity in the categorical condition was significantly greater in the parietal cortex, whereas the coordinate condition revealed greater activity in medial temporal cortex and dorsal striatum. In addition, activity in the categorical condition was greater in parietal cortex within the left hemisphere than within the right. Our findings are consistent with analogous studies in rodents, and support the suggestion of distinct neural circuits underlying categorical and coordinate representations during active spatial navigation. The findings also support the claim of a left hemispheric preponderance for the processing of categorical spatial relations.}

      \field{abstract}{The effect of bilateral lesions of the retrosplenial cortex on discrimination reversal learning of the rabbit nictitating membrane response was examined. Results showed that animals with such lesions were not impaired in their ability to acquire a cross-modality discrimination, but were severely impaired in their ability to reverse the discrimination once it was learned. All animals failed at the reversal phase of the task because they displayed high levels of conditioned responding to both the CS+ and the CS-. Thus bilateral damage to the retrosplenial cortex results in deficits in reversal learning that are highly similar to those observed after bilateral hippocampectomy. These findings are interpreted within a conceptual framework that characterizes multisynaptic projections from the hippocampus to the retrosplenial cortex, and ultimately to the cerebellum, as responsible for the behavioral expression of learning-related changes in hippocampal pyramidal cell activity.}

      \field{abstract}{We recorded head direction (HD) cells from the lateral mammillary nucleus (LMN) and anterior thalamus (ATN) of freely behaving rats and also made bilateral lesions of LMN while recording HD cells from ATN. We discovered that the tuning functions of LMN HD cells become narrower during contraversive head turns, but not ipsiversive head turns, compared to when the head is not turning. This narrowing effect does not occur for ATN HD cells. We also found that the HD signal in LMN leads that in ATN by about 15-20 ms. When LMN was lesioned bilaterally, HD cells in ATN immediately lost their directional firing properties and never recovered them. Based on these findings, we argue that LMN may be an essential component of an attractor-integrator network that participates in generating the HD signal.}

      \field{abstract}{Rats with lesions in the posterodorsal septal area (aimed at transecting the precommissural fornix) and rats with lesions in the prelimbic sector of the medial frontal cortex were tested postoperatively on a neuropsychological test battery comprised of the following tasks: time-spent-eating in two adaptation boxes, time-to-emerge and ambulation in an open field, general activity, contingently-reinforced (continuous) and schedule-specific (delayed non-matching-to-sample) T-maze alternation, visual and olfactory discrimination in a T-maze, temporal alternation (response patterning) and tactile Go/No-Go discrimination in a runway, approach-avoidance conflict in the runway, step-through inhibitory avoidance, one-way active avoidance, two-way active avoidance, and conditioned taste aversion. It was found that: (1) rats with septal (SEP) lesions spent more time eating than control (CON) rats and rats with lesions in prelimbic cortex (PRE). PRE rats did not differ from CON rats; (2) PRE rats emerged into an open field faster, and spent less time in home cage than CON and SEP rats. SEP rats stayed in home cage less than CON rats. PRE and SEP rats crossed more squares in the open field than CON rats; (3) SEP and PRE rats were more active than CON rats; (4) SEP rats performed the contigently-reinforced and schedule-specific T-maze alternation tasks worse than PRE rats, and PRE rats performed these tasks worse than CON rats. PRE, but not SEP, rats showed improvement with continued practice at brief intertrial and interrun intervals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}

Neurotoxic lesions of the POR or PER likewise resulted in anterograde (Experiment 2) and retrograde (Experiment 3) deficits in fear conditioning to the training context in an unsignaled shock paradigm. The results suggest that operations performed on sensory information by the POR and PER are necessary to support contextual learning.}

      \field{abstract}{Postrhinal (POR) or perirhinal (PER) cortex damage impairs acquisition and expression of contextual fear, but the nature of the impairment remains unclear. This study used a contextual fear discrimination paradigm that biased subjects toward using a configural, rather than an elemental, strategy to distinguish between 2 contexts, I of which was paired with a mild footshock. Control rats discriminated between 2 contexts when a combination of several cues could be used (Experiment 1), but not when individual sensory cues were manipulated (Experiment 2). Rats with POR or PER lesions could not discriminate between the shock and no-shock contexts when multiple cues differentiated the contexts (Experiment 3). The results indicate that both the POR and PER have a role in configural learning of contextual fear.}

      \field{abstract}{The perirhinal (PER) and postrhinal (POR) cortices, two components of the medial temporal lobe memory system, are reciprocally connected with the hippocampus both directly and via the entorhinal cortex. Damage to PER or POR before or shortly after training on a contextual fear conditioning task causes deficits in the subsequent expression of contextual fear, implicating these regions in the acquisition or expression of contextual memory. Here, we examined the contribution of PER and POR to the processing of remotely learned contextual information. Male Long-Evans rats were trained in an unsignaled contextual fear conditioning paradigm. After training, rats received bilateral neurotoxic lesions to PER or POR or sham control surgeries at three different training-to-lesion intervals: 1, 28, or 100 d after training. Two weeks after surgery, lesioned and control rats were returned to the training context to assess contextual fear as measured by freezing. Rats with PER or POR damage froze significantly less in the training context than control rats but were not different from each other. The severity of the deficit did not differ across training-to-lesion intervals for any group. This pattern of deficits differs from that of posttraining hippocampal lesions, for which longer training-to-lesion intervals produce significantly more fear-conditioned contextual freezing than shorter training-to-lesion intervals. In the absence of such a retrograde gradient in the present study, our interpretation is that PER and POR have an ongoing role in the storage or retrieval of representations for context. Alternatively, these regions may be involved in a more extended consolidation process that becomes apparent beyond 100 d after learning.}

      \field{abstract}{Hippocampal cell firing in awake, behaving rats is often spatially selective, and such cells have been called place cells. Similar spatial correlates have also been described for neurons in the medial entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. All three regions receive sensory associational input from postrhinal cortex, which, in turn, is heavily interconnected with visuospatial neocortical regions. The spatial selectivity of postrhinal cells, however, has never been examined. Here, we report the activity of neurons in postrhinal cortex of freely moving rats performing a spatial task on a four-arm radial maze. Data are also reported for visual association cortex neurons. The four-arm radial maze was defined by multisensory cues on the surfaces of the maze arms (proximal) and complex visual cues at the surround (distal). On each recording day, rats were run in three conditions: baseline, double cue rotation (proximal +90 degrees; distal -90 degrees), and baseline. In this task, hippocampal place field activity is robust and can be controlled by proximal or distal cues. The majority of postrhinal neurons (64\%) exhibited positional correlates during performance on the task; however, characteristics of these postrhinal cells were substantially different from those previously described for hippocampal place cells. Most postrhinal cells with firing fields exhibited split or multiple subfields (93\%). Unlike hippocampal place fields, the large majority of postrhinal firing fields (84\%) adopted new spatial correlates when experimental cues were rotated, but did so neither predictably nor concordantly. This is the first report of positional firing correlates in the postrhinal cortex. The data are consistent with the idea that postrhinal cortex participates in visuospatial functions by monitoring changes in environmental stimuli rather than encoding stable spatial cues. Thus, postrhinal neurons appear to participate in higher-level perceptual functions rather than mnemonic functions. We propose that the response properties of postrhinal neurons represent an early step in a spatial pathway that culminates in the specific and stable place fields of the hippocampus.}

      \field{abstract}{Spatial and contextual learning are considered to be dependent on the hippocampus, but the extent to which other structures in the medial temporal lobe memory system support these functions is not well understood. This study examined the effects of individual and combined lesions of the perirhinal, postrhinal, and entorhinal cortices on spatial and contextual learning. Lesioned subjects were consistently impaired on measures of contextual fear learning and consistently unimpaired on spatial learning in the Morris water maze. Neurotoxic lesions of perirhinal or postrhinal cortex that were previously shown to impair contextual fear conditioning (Bucci et al., 2000) or contextual discrimination (Bucci et al., 2002) caused little or no impairment in place learning and incidental learning in the water maze. Combined lesions of perirhinal plus lateral entorhinal or postrhinal plus medial entorhinal cortices resulted in deficits in acquisition of contextual discrimination but had no effect on place learning in the water maze. Finally, a parahippocampal lesion comprising combined neurotoxic damage to perirhinal, postrhinal, and entorhinal cortices resulted in profound impairment in acquisition of a standard passive avoidance task but failed to impair place learning. In the same experiment, rats with hippocampal lesions were impaired in spatial navigation. These results indicate that tasks requiring the association between context and an aversive stimulus depend on corticohippocampal circuitry, whereas place learning in the water maze can be accomplished without the full complement of highly processed information from the cortical regions surrounding the hippocampus. The evidence that different brain systems underlie spatial navigation and contextual learning has implications for research on memory when parahippocampal regions are involved.}

      \field{abstract}{This study investigated the effects of visual and ideothetic cues on the spatial tuning of head-direction (HD) cells recorded in the rat posterior cortices. Extracellular, single unit responses were recorded from animals performing each of two different tasks, a spatial working memory task on a radial-arm maze and a passive rotation task on a modified "lazy Susan" platform. The influence of visual cues was assessed by manipulating the position of one white and three black cue-cards placed around the maze. We found three major categories of HD cells based on their response to cue manipulations in the maze tasks. Type A cells (10/41) rotated their preferred directions along with the rotation of the cues. The majority (type B, 25/41) of the HD cells were unaffected by the rotation of visual cues, maintaining their established preferred direction. Type C cells (6/41) showed complex responses to cue rotation, with the preferred direction reflecting either a combination of both type A and type B responses or an unpredictable response. The results indicate that the internal representation of directionality can be calibrated by visual cues and that some mnemonic processes may have been involved in the registration of the previous cue locations. Eleven cells were tested in both the maze task and the passive rotation task. Most (9/11) showed a significant directionality in the former task, but showed either no or weak directionality in the latter task, suggesting that movement-related ideothetic cues may be used in supporting the directional firing of these cells. Only two cells showed significant directionality in both tasks. Their established preferred directions did not rotate along with the cues in the maze task, but did rotate with the cues in the passive rotation task. We conclude that the dynamic aspect of the directional tuning in these cortical HD cells may represent on-line calibration of an angular coordinate representation.}

      \field{abstract}{We examined the behavioral modulation of head-directional information processing in neurons of the rat posterior cortices, including the medial prestriate (area Oc2M) and retrosplenial cortex (areas RSA and RSG). Single neurons were recorded in freely moving rats which were trained to perform a spatial working memory task on a radial-arm maze in a cue-controlled room. A dual-light-emitting diode (dual-LED) recording headstage, mounted on the animals' heads, was used to track head position and orientation. Planar modes of motion, such as turns, straight motion, and nonlocomotive states, were categorized using an objective scheme based upon the differential contributions of movement parameters, including linear and angular velocity of the head. Of 662 neurons recorded from the posterior cortices, 41 head-direction (HD) cells were identified based on the criterion of maintained directional bias in the absence of visual cues or in the dark. HD cells constituted 7 of 257 (2.7\%) cells recorded in Oc2M, 26 of 311 (8.4\%) cells in RSA, and 8 of 94 (8.5\%) cells in RSG. Spatial tuning of HD cell firing was modulated by the animal's behaviors in some neurons. The behavioral modulation occurred either at the preferred direction or at all directions. Moreover, the behavioral selectivity was more robust for turns than straight motions, suggesting that the angular movements may significantly contribute to the head-directional processing. These behaviorally selective HD cells were observed most frequently in Oc2M (4/7, 57\%), as only 5 of 26 (19\%) of RSA cells and none of the RSG cells showed behavioral modulation. These data, taken together with the anatomical evidence for a cascade of projections from Oc2M to RSA and thence to RSG, suggest that there may be a simple association between movement and head-directionality that serves to transform the egocentric movement representation in the neocortex into an allocentric directional representation in the periallocortex.}

      \field{abstract}{Rats with medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, or cortical control lesions were tested on an eight-arm radial maze task, in order to examine memory for the temporal order of spatial locations as a function of temporal lag. During the study phase of each trial, rats were allowed to visit each of eight arms once in an order that was randomly selected for that trial. The test phase required the rats to choose which of two arms occurred earlier in the sequence of arms visited during the study phase. The arms selected as test arms varied according to temporal lag (0-6) or the number of arms that occurred between the two test arms in the study phase. The control rats performed at chance at a temporal lag of zero, but their performance was above chance for the remaining lags, improving after the temporal lag exceeded zero. The hippocampal-lesioned rats showed a marked deficit, performing at chance for all lags, with some savings for those items occurring at the end of the list. The medial prefrontal cortex-lesioned rats showed a less severe deficit. The results of these data support the notion that both the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex play significant roles in memory for the temporal order of spatial locations.}

      \field{abstract}{The contribution of the hippocampus to relational association learning was examined using a paired associate task in the rat. Using a go/no-go paradigm, rats were trained to respond quickly on positive pair presentations, and to withhold responding on negative pair presentations. Using four constant three-dimensional objects (A, B, C and D), pairing of either AB or CD was assigned as positive pairs, whereas the other possible object combinations (AC, DB, AD, and CB) were never associated with reinforcement. A further type of negative pair trial was also studied which involved object-pairs composed of one of the four constant objects and another object, which varied from trial, and which was selected from a set of 120 junk objects. Electrolytic lesions of the hippocampus were performed on the rats which had previously acquired the paired associate task. Results indicated that hippocampal lesions did not significantly impair the ability of the animals to solve the paired associate task. To study further the exact nature of the learned associations, a transfer test which involved a reversal of the spatial position within each of the six positive as well as negative pair-types was conducted. Results of the transfer test demonstrated that hippocampal-lesioned as well as control rats performed normally by distinguishing the positive from negative pairs regardless of the relative location of stimuli within the object pairs. These data suggest that the hippocampus might not be critical for relational object associations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

      \field{abstract}{Twenty-four rats assigned to 1 of 3 matched groups (control, entorhinal cortex [EC], and parietal cortex [PC]) were trained on 6 successive discrimination problems (2 in an 8-arm for pretraining and 4 in a 12-arm radial maze for training per se). The training on the 12-arm maze started 6, 4, 2, and 0.5 weeks before surgery. On the day after the rats learned the last problem, they were given surgery according to groups. Postoperative retention was measured by presenting 16 trials per session for each of the problems during 4 sessions. Results indicate that the EC lesions produced a retention deficit for problems learned immediately and up to 4 weeks before surgery, but not for the problem acquired 6 weeks before the lesions. The PC lesions produced a significant retrograde amnesia that was not temporally graded. Results demonstrate that the EC and PC make important, albeit distinct, contributions to spatial memory storage and retrieval in rats.}

      \field{abstract}{Memory processes may be independent, compete, operate in parallel, or interact. In accordance with this view, behavioral studies suggest that the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) may act as an integrated circuit during performance of tasks that require working memory over longer delays, whereas during short delays the HPC and PFC may operate in parallel or have completely dissociable functions. In the present investigation we tested rats in a spatial delayed non-match to sample working memory task using short and long time delays to evaluate the hypothesis that intermediate CA1 region of the HPC (iCA1) and medial PFC (mPFC) interact and operate in parallel under different temporal working memory constraints. In order to assess the functional role of these structures, we used an inactivation strategy in which each subject received bilateral chronic cannula implantation of the iCA1 and mPFC, allowing us to perform bilateral, contralateral, ipsilateral, and combined bilateral inactivation of structures and structure pairs within each subject. This novel approach allowed us to test for circuit-level systems interactions, as well as independent parallel processing, while we simultaneously parametrically manipulated the temporal dimension of the task. The current results suggest that, at longer delays, iCA1 and mPFC interact to coordinate retrospective and prospective memory processes in anticipation of obtaining a remote goal, whereas at short delays either structure may independently represent spatial information sufficient to successfully complete the task.}

      \field{abstract}{The dentate gyrus (DG) of the mammalian hippocampus is hypothesized to mediate pattern separation-the formation of distinct and orthogonal representations of mnemonic information-and also undergoes neurogenesis throughout life. How neurogenesis contributes to hippocampal function is largely unknown. Using adult mice in which hippocampal neurogenesis was ablated, we found specific impairments in spatial discrimination with two behavioral assays: (i) a spatial navigation radial arm maze task and (ii) a spatial, but non-navigable, task in the mouse touch screen. Mice with ablated neurogenesis were impaired when stimuli were presented with little spatial separation, but not when stimuli were more widely separated in space. Thus, newborn neurons may be necessary for normal pattern separation function in the DG of adult mice.}

      \field{abstract}{Rats prepared with lesions of the prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, hippocampus, or medial septal area were tested for acquisition of a number of variations of the open-field water maze using a version of place learning assessment described by Eichenbaum, Stewart, and Morris (1991). Specifically, the individual role of the aforementioned cortical and subcortical structures in tasks with differing representational demands on navigation were assessed. The results suggest that the sham-operated control, posterior parietal cortex-lesioned rats, and medial septal area-lesioned rats were able to navigate effectively under changing task conditions. Conversely, the navigational performances of the prefrontal cortex- and hippocampal formation-lesioned rats were impaired when task demands changed. The results are discussed in terms of the flexible use of multiple distal cues to guide navigation and the resulting loss of this flexibility after lesions to either the prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus.}

      \field{abstract}{Path integration is presumed to rely on self-motion cues to identify locations in space and is subject to cumulative error. The authors tested the hypothesis that rats use memory to reduce such errors and that the retrosplenial cortex contributes to this process. Rats were trained for 1 week to hoard food in an arena after beginning a trial from a fixed starting location; probe trials were then conducted in which they began a trial from a novel place in light or darkness. After control injections, rats searched around the training location, showing normal spatial memory. Inactivation of the retrosplenial cortex disrupted this search preference. To assess accuracy during navigation, rats were then trained to perform multiple trials daily, with a fixed or a different starting location in light or darkness. Retrosplenial cortex inactivation impaired accuracy in darkness. The retrosplenial cortex may provide mnemonic information, which decreases errors when navigating in the dark.}

      \field{abstract}{A delayed matching-to-sample task was designed to assess memory for direction information in rats. During the study phase, rats traversed a maze arm oriented in 1 of 3 directions. After a delay period, a test phase was presented that required a choice between the study phase direction and a foil direction. Once rats reached a learning criterion, probe trials suggested that normal rats favor the use of direction, rather than turning response, information and use vestibular feedback. Rats were then given hippocampus, medial caudate nucleus (MCN), or cortical control lesions. Unlike control rats, those with hippocampus and MCN lesions exhibited marked impairments when retested. However, all rats were able to learn a direction discrimination task. These results suggest that the hippocampus and MCN support processes associated with short-term memory for direction information.}

      \field{abstract}{Rats were taught 1 of 3 types of multiple-object scene discrimination. Manipulations included either replacing (object based), displacing (space based), or replacing and displacing (object/space based) 1 object in the scene. Once trained, rats received hippocampal, parietal cortex, or cortical control lesions and then were retested. Parietal cortex- and hippocampal-lesioned rats displayed deficits on both the space and object/space tasks but not the object task. The hippocampal-lesioned group's deficit on the object/space task was only transient, whereas the impairments of the parietal cortex-lesioned rats were stable for both tasks. The parietal cortex-lesioned rats sustained difficulty with the object/space task may indicate an inability to switch cognitive strategies.}

      \field{abstract}{Memory for magnitude of reinforcement was assessed in rats using a go/no-go short-term memory paradigm. During the task's study phase rats were given a piece of cereal comprised of either 25 or 50\% sugar. For all trials, one of the cereal types was designated positive, the other negative. On the ensuing test phase the rat was presented with an object which covered a food well. If a positive food reward was given during the study phase, a second food reward was placed beneath the object. No food reward was placed under the object if the study phase consisted of a negative food reward. Latency to object displacement was used as the measure of performance. Following the establishment of a significant difference between latency to approach the object with reward compared to latency to approach the object without reward, rats were given either agranular insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, pre- and infralimbic cortex or control lesions. Agranular insular cortex lesioned animals demonstrated a mild post-surgery impairment. Trials consisting of 10 and 20 s delays between the study and test phases were then introduced. Delays exacerbated the previous deficit of the agranular insular cortex lesion group, but had little effect on the other lesion groups. All animals transferred to a new set of cereals containing 25 and 50\% sugar and exhibited taste preferences to sugar solutions of different concentrations. These results indicate that the agranular insular cortex may play an important role in the processing of affect-laden information within a prefrontal cortex short-term or working memory system.}

      \field{abstract}{The aim of this study was to determine the role of the dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) in object recognition memory using a black box and object-context recognition memory using a clear box with available cues that define a spatial context. Based on a 10 min retention interval between the study phase and the test phase, the results indicated that dDG lesioned rats are impaired when compared to controls in the object-context recognition test in the clear box. However, there were no reliable differences between the dDG lesioned rats and the control group for the object recognition test in the black box. Even though the dDG lesioned rats were more active in object exploration, the habituation gradients did not differ. These results suggest that the dentate gyrus lesioned rats are clearly impaired when there is an important contribution of context. Furthermore, based on a 24 h retention interval in the black box the dDG lesioned rats were impaired compared to controls.}

      \field{abstract}{A two-trial memory task, based on place or object exploration in a Y-maze, was developed to study recognition processes in young and aged Sprague-Dawley rats (Dellu et al., 1992). This paradigm avoids the use of electric shocks or deprivations that may have nonspecific effects, and the task does not require learning of a rule, i.e., involves essentially working memory. A number of behavioral parameters in several animals could be recorded automatically, thus allowing a detailed analysis of behavior and a simultaneous testing of several animals. We extended this task in order to evaluate the role of contextual information in recognition memory. When the contextual environment during acquisition and retrieval trials was unchanged, place recognition remained intact despite interpolated explorations. When the contextual environment during acquisition and retrieval trials was changed, object recognition was impaired. It was clearly shown that the correct choice between two discrete cues (e.g., small objects) is conditional on more diffuse environmental cues. Thus, it can be hypothesized that at least two kinds of recognition processes can be assessed in animals: an automatic process, based on a discrimination between familiarity and novelty, and a second process, more cognitively based and more effortful. In conclusion, the two-trial task in the Y-maze is sensitive, specific, and fast. It allows the study of both spatial and nonspatial memory, allows the study of different levels (automatic vs controlled) of cognitive processes and their neuroanatomical substrates, and may be profitably employed in aging studies and neuropharmacological research in general.}

      \field{abstract}{Acquisition of odor-guided or visually-guided delayed win-shift behavior was evaluated in rats after lidocaine-induced inactivation within the agranular insular area of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) or the prelimbic area of the PFC. Additional sites and tasks were used to control for neuroanatomical and behavioral specificity of lidocaine inactivation of the agranular insular and prelimbic areas. Results showed that acquisition of the odor-guided delayed win-shift task was dependent on the agranular insular area, whereas acquisition of the visually-guided version was dependent on the prelimbic area. This dissociation suggests that the stimulus modality used is critical for revealing working memory functions of different PFC subregions. The described methods provide a complementary means to study working memory in PFC subregions using a radial-arm maze.}

      \field{abstract}{The prefrontal cortex is implicated in such human characteristics as volition, planning, abstract reasoning and affect. Frontal-lobe damage can cause disinhibition such that the behaviour of a subject is guided by previously acquired responses that are inappropriate to the current situation. Here we demonstrate that disinhibition, or a loss of inhibitory control, can be selective for particular cognitive functions and that different regions of the prefrontal cortex provide inhibitory control in different aspects of cognitive processing. Thus, whereas damage to the lateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 9) in monkeys causes a loss of inhibitory control in attentional selection, damage to the orbito-frontal cortex in monkeys causes a loss of inhibitory control in 'affective' processing, thereby impairing the ability to alter behaviour in response to fluctuations in the emotional significance of stimuli. These findings not only support the view that the prefrontal cortex has multiple functions, but also provide evidence for the distribution of different cognitive functions within specific regions of prefrontal cortex.}

      \field{abstract}{Separate groups of rats with lesions in the parietal cortex (PC) or hippocampal formation (HF) were tested for acquisition and retention of the Morris water maze cognitive mapping task. Some of the animals in each lesion group received preoperative training in the task. Other animals in each group received no preoperative training. The results indicate that although both lesions lead to a cognitive mapping impairment in both the acquisition and retention of the task, the animals with PC lesions were more severely impaired than were the animals with HF lesions, as indicated by quantitative measures. However, qualitative aspects of the animals' swim behavior indicate that the HF damaged animals tend to use "nonmapping" strategies to solve the tasks, which suggests that the qualitative nature of their impairment differs from that of the PC damaged animals. The results of this study support the hypothesis that PC plays an important role in the processing of information about space that is allocentric or external to the body.}

      \field{abstract}{The generality of the place-learning impairment associated with hippocampal system damage was challenged using methods of training that permitted subjects to form an individual association between the place of escape and a particular navigational route in an open-field water maze. Both normal rats and rats with fornix lesions (FX rats) acquired this task rapidly, although FX rats were slightly slower in achieving minimum escape latencies. In postcriterion testing, FX rats occasionally made near misses but, more often, their escape performance was indistinguishable from that of intact rats. Results from a variety of probe tests indicated that FX rats, like normal rats, had based their performance on a representation of multiple distal cues but their representation, unlike that of normal rats, was inflexible in that it could not be used to guide performance when the cues or starting position were altered. These results parallel those from other studies of hippocampal function in animals and humans: The learning deficit consequent to hippocampal system damage (1) is not specific to a particular category of learning materials, but is dependent on the representational demands of the task; (2) is observed when task demands encourage a representation based on relations among multiple cues, but not when the task encourages adaptation to an individual (or compound) stimulus; (3) spares acquisition of fundamental procedures needed to perform the task; and (4) impairs the flexible use of learned information in tests other than repetition of the learning experience.}

      \field{abstract}{The ability to recognize a previously experienced stimulus is supported by two processes: recollection of the stimulus in the context of other information associated with the experience, and a sense of familiarity with the features of the stimulus. Although familiarity and recollection are functionally distinct, there is considerable debate about how these kinds of memory are supported by regions in the medial temporal lobes (MTL). Here, we review evidence for the distinction between recollection and familiarity and then consider the evidence regarding the neural mechanisms of these processes. Evidence from neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological studies of humans, monkeys, and rats indicates that different subregions of the MTL make distinct contributions to recollection and familiarity. The data suggest that the hippocampus is critical for recollection but not familiarity. The parahippocampal cortex also contributes to recollection, possibly via the representation and retrieval of contextual (especially spatial) information, whereas perirhinal cortex contributes to and is necessary for familiarity-based recognition. The findings are consistent with an anatomically guided hypothesis about the functional organization of the MTL and suggest mechanisms by which the anatomical components of the MTL interact to support the phenomenology of recollection and familiarity.}

      \field{abstract}{The detailed course of learning is studied for categorization tasks defined by independent or contingent probability distributions over the features of category exemplars. College-age subjects viewed sequences of bar charts that simulated symptom patterns and responded to each chart with a recognition and a categorization judgment. Fuzzy, probabilistically defined categories were learned relatively rapidly when individual features were correlated with category assignment, more slowly when only patterns carried category information. Limits of performance were suboptimal, evidently because of capacity limitations on judgmental processes as well as limitations on memory. Categorization proved systematically related to feature and exemplar probabilities, under different circumstances, and to similarity among exemplars of categories. Unique retrieval cues for exemplar patterns facilitated recognition but entered into categorization only at retention intervals within the range of short-term memory. The findings are interpreted within the framework of a general array model that yields both exemplar-similarity and feature-frequency models as special cases and provides quantitative accounts of the course of learning in each of the categorization tasks studied.}

      \field{abstract}{It is often assumed that navigation implies the use, by animals, of landmarks indicating the location of the goal. However, many animals (including humans) are able to return to the starting point of a journey, or to other goal sites, by relying on self-motion cues only. This process is known as path integration, and it allows an agent to calculate a route without making use of landmarks. We review the current literature on path integration and its interaction with external, location-based cues. Special importance is given to the correlation between observable behavior and the activity pattern of particular neural cell populations that implement the internal representation of space. In mammals, the latter may well be the first high-level cognitive representation to be understood at the neural level.}

      \field{abstract}{The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the rat plays an essential role in behavioral flexibility, as lesions or inactivations of this region impair shifting between strategies or attentional sets using a variety of different behavioral tests. In the present study, we assessed the effects of inactivation of the mPFC on strategy set-shifting and reversal learning, using a novel, automated procedure conducted in an operant chamber. In Experiment 1, inactivation of the mPFC with bupivacaine did not impair the initial learning of a visual-cue (i.e.; always press the lever with a cue light illuminated above it) or a response (i.e.; always press the left lever) discrimination. Control rats required greater number of trials to shift from using a visual-cue to a response strategy than the opposite shift. mPFC inactivation impaired performance of a visual-cue-response set-shift, but not the easier response-visual-cue shift. In Experiment 2, pre-exposure to the visual-cue stimulus lights increased the difficulty of the response-visual-cue shift, reflected by a greater number of trials required by control rats to achieve criterion relative to those in Experiment 1. Under these conditions, inactivation of the mPFC did impair performance of this set-shift. In contrast, mPFC inactivation did not affect reversal learning of a response discrimination. These findings highlight the utility of this automated procedure for assessing set-shifting mediated by the mPFC. Furthermore, they reveal that the relative difficulty of the type of shift rats are required to perform has a direct impact on whether or not the mPFC contributes to this form of behavioral flexibility.}

      \field{abstract}{The medial dorsal nuclei of the thalamus (MDNt), the prefrontal cortex, and the ventral striatum form an interconnected neural circuit that may subserve certain types of working memory. The present series of experiments investigated functional interactions between these brain regions in rats during the performance of delayed and nondelayed spatially cued radial-arm maze tasks. In Experiment 1, transient inactivation of the MDNt by a bilateral injection of lidocaine selectively disrupted performance on a delayed task but not on a nondelayed random foraging version of the radial arm maze task. In Experiment 2, asymmetrical lidocaine injections into the MDNt on one side of the brain and the prefrontal cortex on the other transiently disconnected these two brain regions and significantly impaired foraging during the delayed task. Similarly, disconnections between the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens also disrupted foraging on this task, whereas disconnections between the MDNt and the nucleus accumbens had no effect. These data suggest that serial transmission of information among the MDNt, the prefrontal cortex, and the nucleus accumbens is required when trial-unique, short-term spatial memory is used to guide prospective search behavior. The results are discussed with respect to a distributed neural network linking limbic, thalamic, cortical, and striatal regions, which mediates executive functions of working memory.}

      \field{abstract}{When hooded rats with bilateral lesions of Krieg's area 7 (parietal cortex) were trained to locomote toward visual targets in a runway, they ran less accurately than did controls, although unilaterals ran accurately. When flashing lights were presented unexpectedly during their run, bilateral parietals were less disrupted than were controls, but they failed to show total neglect. Unilateral paritals turned toward distracters on either side but turned preferentially toward distracters contralateral to the intact hemisphere, particularly when distracters occurred bilaterally and simultaneously. Effects due to the omission of expected distracters were similar in parietals and controls. Rat parietal cortex is not essential for the redirection of attention to stimuli notable for their unexpected presence or absence, but parietal cortex may resolve interhemispheric competition. The results suggest a homology between parietal cortex in rat and primate.}

      \field{abstract}{The rat medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is believed to play a central role in working memory and selective attention processes. More recently, it has been shown that the effects of large PFC lesions on working memory may be due to the prelimbic area of the PFC. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of lesions of the prelimbic area with PFC lesions that involved or spared the prelimbic area on shuttlebox avoidance and radial maze learning in rats. The findings indicate that rats with PFC lesions that spared the prelimbic area were impaired at avoidance but not radial arm maze learning, whereas rats with prelimbic lesions or PFC lesions that included this area were impaired on the radial arm maze but not the avoidance learning task. Results support the notion that the medial frontal cortex of the rat is a functionally dissociable region and suggest that the prelimbic area appears to be critical for working memory, but less so for attention processes.}

      \field{abstract}{Experiments were designed to determine whether 2 regions of the head direction cell circuit, the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (ADN) and the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN), contribute to navigation. Rats were trained to perform a food-carrying task with and without blindfolds prior to receiving sham lesions or bilateral lesions of the ADN or DTN. ADN-lesioned rats were mildly impaired in both versions of the task. DTN-lesioned rats, however, were severely impaired and showed reduced heading accuracy in both task versions. These findings suggest that although both the DTN and ADN contribute to navigation based on path integration and landmarks, disruption of the head direction cell circuit at the level of the DTN has a significantly greater effect on spatial behavior than lesions of the ADN.}

      \field{abstract}{Several subregions in the limbic thalamus have been suggested as the key locus for diencephalic amnesia, including the anterior thalamic nuclei, intralaminar nuclei and mediodorsal nuclei. There is, however, no consensus as to a single critical site and recent research has suggested instead that different thalamic areas may contribute to diencephalic amnesia in subtly different ways. This study compared the effects of lesions to anterior (AT), lateral (LT) and posteromedial (MT) aggregates of thalamic nuclei on Gilbert and Kesner's [Gilbert, PE, Kesner, RP. Role of the rodent hippocampus in paired-associate learning involving associations between a stimulus and a spatial location. Behavioral Neuroscience 2002;116(1):63-71; Gilbert, PE, Kesner, RP. Localization of function within the dorsal hippocampus: the role of the CA3 subregion in paired-associate learning. Behavioral Neuroscience 2003;117(6):1385-94] paired-associate task, in which rats were postoperatively trained to form an arbitrary association between odours and spatial locations in a circular open field. Both AT and LT lesions, but not MT lesions, severely impaired odour-place paired-associate learning. Probe trials revealed that the rats were not using specific location information after acquisition training. All groups were able to learn non-associative odour and place discrimination tasks quickly, with only the AT group showing delayed acquisition. This study provides the first direct comparison of different thalamic lesions on paired-associate learning and new evidence on the importance of the LT region in learning and memory. The results support the notion that injury to both the AT and LT subregions of the thalamus may each be major contributors to diencephalic amnesia. There is need for traditional models of memory function to take greater account of the contributions of thalamic nuclei.}

      \field{abstract}{The ability of rats with control or hippocampal lesions to learn an object-place, odor-place, or object-odor paired-associate task was assessed in a cheeseboard maze apparatus. The data indicate that rats with hippocampal lesions were significantly impaired, compared with controls, in learning both the object-place and the odor-place paired-associate tasks. However, rats with hippocampal lesions learned the object-odor paired-associate task as readily as did controls. The data suggest that the rodent hippocampus is involved in paired-associate learning when a stimulus must be associated with a spatial location. However, the hippocampus is not involved in paired-associate learning when the association does not involve a spatial component.}

      \field{abstract}{Computational models and electrophysiological data suggest that the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus supports the formation of arbitrary associations; however, no behavioral studies have been conducted to test this hypothesis. Rats with neurotoxin-induced lesions of dorsal dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, or CA1 were tested on object-place and odor-place paired-associate tasks to test whether the mechanism that supports paired-associate learning is localized to the CA3 subregion of the dorsal hippocampus or whether all hippocampal subregions contribute to paired-associate learning. The data indicate that rats with DG or CA1 lesions learned the tasks as well as controls; however, CA3-lesioned rats were impaired in learning the tasks.

      \field{abstract}{A paradigm based on measuring short-term memory for spatial location information as a function of spatial similarity between distal cues was developed to examine the role of pattern separation in the modulation of short-term memory for spatial information. A delayed-match-to-sample for spatial location task using a dryland version of the Morris water maze was used to assess spatial pattern separation in male Long-Evans rats. In the sample phase, animals were trained to displace an object that covered a baited food well in one of 15 spatial locations along a row of food wells perpendicular to a start box. In the ensuing choice phase, the animal was allowed to choose between two objects identical to the sample phase object. One covered the same baited food well as did the object in the study phase (correct choice), and another foil object (incorrect choice) covered a different unbaited food well along the row of wells. Five spatial separations were randomly used to separate the correct object from the foil object. After reaching a criterion before the operation, animals were given either hippocampal or cortical control lesions. In trials after the operation, control animals matched their performance before the operation across all spatial separations. In contrast, hippocampal-lesioned animals displayed impairments across all spatial separations with the exception of the longest (105 cm) spatial separation. The results suggest that the hippocampus may serve to separate incoming spatial information by temporarily storing one place separate from another. It is proposed that hippocampal lesions decrease efficiency in pattern separation, resulting in impairments in trials with increased spatial similarity among working-memory representations.}

      \field{abstract}{This study presents a double dissociation between the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1. Rats with either DG or CA1 lesions were tested on tasks requiring either spatial or spatial temporal order pattern separation. To assess spatial pattern separation, rats were trained to displace an object which covered a baited food-well. The rats were then allowed to choose between two identical objects: one covered the same well as the sample phase object (correct choice), and a second object covered a different unbaited well (incorrect choice). Spatial separations of 15-105 cm were used to separate the correct object from the incorrect object. To assess spatial temporal order pattern separation, rats were allowed to visit each arm of a radial eight-arm maze once in a randomly determined sequence. The rats were then presented with two arms and were required to choose the arm which occurred earliest in the sequence. The choice arms varied according to temporal separation (0, 2, 4, or 6) or the number of arms that occurred between the two choice arms in the sample phase sequence. On each task, once a preoperative criterion was reached, each rat was given either a DG, CA1, or control lesion and then retested. The results demonstrated that DG lesions resulted in a deficit on the spatial task but not the temporal task. In contrast, CA1 lesions resulted in a deficit on the temporal task but not the spatial task. Results suggest that the DG supports spatial pattern separation, whereas CA1 supports temporal pattern separation.}

      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: Neural circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) support translation of the external environment to an internal map of space, with grid and head direction neurons providing metrics for distance and orientation. RESULTS: We show here that head direction cells in MEC are organized topographically. Head direction tuning varies widely across the entire dorsoventral MEC axis, but in layer III there is a gradual dorsal-to-ventral increase in the average width of the directional firing field. Sharply tuned cells were encountered only at the dorsal end of MEC. Similar topography was not observed among head direction cells in layers V-VI. At all MEC locations, in all layers, the preferred firing direction (directional phase) showed a uniform distribution. The continuity of the dorsoventral tuning gradient coexisted with discrete topography in the spatial scale of simultaneously recorded grid cells. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to dorsoventral gradients as a fundamental property of entorhinal circuits, upon which modular organization may be expressed in select subpopulations.}

      \field{abstract}{Rats were trained on a delayed matching-to-sample for a spatial location task to examine spatial pattern completion. On the sample phase of the task, rats were trained to move a small black block covering a food well that could appear in one of five possible spatial locations. During the choice phase of the task, rats were required to find the same food well, with the block removed so as to receive reinforcement. After reaching stable performance in terms of accuracy to find the correct location, rats received neurotoxic injections into the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus. The control group received vehicle injections into the CA3 subregion. After surgery, four extramaze cues were always available during the sample phase, but during the choice phase zero, one, two, three, or four cues were removed. The results indicate that normal vehicle control injected rats display excellent pattern completion across all reductions in the availability of cues, whereas rats with CA3 lesions are impaired in pattern completion as indicated by a linear increase in errors as the number of available cues is reduced. It appears that the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus plays an important role in spatial pattern completion.}

      \field{abstract}{Rodents use two distinct navigation strategies that are based on environmental cues (landmark navigation) or internal cues (path integration). Head direction (HD) cells are neurons that discharge when the animal points its head in a particular direction and are responsive to the same cues that support path integration and landmark navigation. Experiment 1 examined whether HD cells in rats with lesions to the hippocampus plus the overlying neocortex or to just the overlying neocortex could maintain a stable preferred firing direction when the rats locomoted from a familiar to a novel environment, a process thought to require path integration. HD cells from both lesion groups were unable to maintain a similar preferred direction between environments, with cells from hippocampal rats showing larger shifts than cells from rats sustaining only cortical damage. When the rats first explored the novel environment, the preferred directions of the cells drifted for up to 4 min before establishing a consistent firing orientation. The preferred direction was usually maintained during subsequent visits to the novel environment but not across longer time periods (days to weeks). Experiment 2 demonstrated that a novel landmark cue was able to establish control over HD cell preferred directions in rats from both lesion groups, showing that the impairment observed in experiment 1 cannot be attributed to an impairment in establishing cue control. Experiment 3 showed that the preferred direction drifted when HD cells in lesioned animals were recorded in the dark. It was also shown that the anticipatory property of anterodorsal thalamic nucleus HD cells was still present in lesioned animals; thus, this property cannot be attributed to an intact hippocampus. These findings suggest that the hippocampus and the overlying neocortex are involved in path integration mechanisms, which enable an animal to maintain an accurate representation of its directional heading when exploring a novel environment.}

      \field{abstract}{Human research has shown that lesions of the parietal cortex disrupt spatial information processing, specifically topological information. Similar findings have been found in non-humans. It has been difficult to determine homologies between human and non-human mnemonic mechanisms for spatial information processing because methodologies and neuropathology differ. The first objective of the present study was to adapt a previously established human task for rats. The second objective was to better characterize the role of parietal cortex (PC) and dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) for topological spatial information processing. Rats had to distinguish whether a ball inside a ring or a ball outside a ring was the correct, rewarded object. After rats reached criterion on the task (>95\%) they were randomly assigned to a lesion group (control, PC, and dHPC). Animals were then re-tested. Post-surgery data show that controls were 94\% correct on average, dHPC rats were 89\% correct on average, and PC rats were 56\% correct on average. The results from the present study suggest that the parietal cortex, but not the dHPC processes topological spatial information. The present data are the first to support comparable topological spatial information processes of the parietal cortex in humans and rats.}

The topological task consisted of 4 different objects placed in a square orientation. After habituation, the first 2 objects were switched, and after the rats habituated to that change, the back 2 objects were switched. This was repeated on a different day with 4 new objects.

      \field{abstract}{Information gleaned from learning and memory processes is essential in guiding behavior toward a specific goal. However, the neural mechanisms that determine how these processes are effectively utilized to guide goal-directed behavior are unknown. Here, we show that rats utilize retrospective and prospective memory and flexible switching between these 2 memory processes to guide behaviors to obtain rewards. We found that retrospective memory is mainly processed in the hippocampus (HPC) but that this retrospective information must be incorporated within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to be used to switch to an anticipatory response strategy involving prospective memory. Furthermore, switching between memory processes is regulated by the mesocortical dopamine (DA) system. Thus, DA D1 and D2 receptor activation in the PFC differentially affects retrospective memory processing within the HPC via an indirect feedback pathway. In contrast, D1, but not D2, receptor activation is crucial for incorporation of HPC-based retrospective information into the PFC. However, once this takes place, D2 receptor activation is required for further processing of information to effect preparation of future actions. These results provide a unique perspective on the mechanism of memory-based goal-directed behavior.}

      \field{abstract}{This study examined the effects of lesions of the prelimbic area of the rat prefrontal cortex on acquisition and retention of nonmatching (NMTS) and matching-to-sample (MTS) tasks. Both tasks involved a reference and a working memory component, but only working memory was impaired by the lesions. A comparison of the 2 tasks revealed quantitatively similar deficits in postoperatively trained rats. In preoperatively trained rats, however, the deficits were more important in the MTS task than in the NMTS task. In addition, an effect of interference between successive trials was observed in the NMTS task but not in the MTS task. Perseverative tendencies were observed in the MTS task only. These results suggest that prefrontal lesions induce working memory deficits as a result of poor temporal encoding and increased susceptibility to interference and impair effortful processing, such as that engaged in response selection mechanisms.}

      \field{abstract}{An important aspect of decision making is the ability of responses to be controlled by different cues in different situations or contexts, especially when there is conflict between alternative responses or actions.Recently, a context-dependent biconditional task has been developed for rats that mimic some aspects of response conflict seen in human cognitive paradigms, such as the Stroop task. In this task, contextual cues are used to disambiguate conflicting response information provided by audiovisual compound stimuli. Here we review current findings that investigate some of the behavioral, neurobiological, and neurochemical mechanisms that underlie this use of contextual or task-setting information to resolve response conflict, and discuss future ways in which this research can be extended.}

      \field{abstract}{Hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons were recorded in rats performing a delayed-match-to-sample (DMTS) task. Complex spike cells showed significant firing peaks following sample and match responses and during delivery of water reward. Individual cells were classified into 4 subtypes according to the presence or absence of firing in each of these 3 phases. There were significant differences in delay interval firing among the 4 subtypes, but firing during the delay did not predict the correct response: 34\% of the cells showed a linear change in firing during the delay. Further analyses revealed significant lever position firing biases in approximately 70\% of the cells tested irrespective of subtype. The complexity of firing correlates of the neurons recorded in this DMTS task suggests that the hippocampus divides specific aspects of the performance demands of the task across different cell subtypes, which together provide sufficient information to resolve the matching-to-sample problem on any given trial.}

      \field{abstract}{The prefrontal cortex in rats can be distinguished anatomically from other frontal cortical areas both in terms of cytoarchitectonic characteristics and neural connectivity, and it can be further subdivided into subterritories on the basis of such criteria. Functionally, the prefrontal cortex of rats has been implicated in working memory, attention, response initiation and management of autonomic control and emotion. In humans, dysfunction of prefrontal cortical areas with which the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat is most likely comparable is related to psychopathology including schizophrenia, sociopathy, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and drug abuse. Recent literature points to the relevance of conducting a functional analysis of prefrontal subregions and supports the idea that the area of the medial prefrontal cortex in rats is characterized by its own functional heterogeneity, which may be related to neuroanatomical and neurochemical dissociations. The present review covers recent findings with the intent of correlating these distinct functional differences in the dorso-ventral axis of the rat medial prefrontal cortex with anatomical and neurochemical patterns.}

      \field{abstract}{Rats' exploratory patterns on a complex elevated maze were analyzed in both light and dark conditions. Rats were less active in the light than in the dark. In the light, they spent more time exploring the outer areas of the maze than the inner areas whereas exploration of both regions was similar in the dark. In both light and dark, rats spent more time investigating choice points (which provided multiple directions for movements) than runways that allowed only simple movements. In addition, choice points that provided more connections with other distant places were associated with more exploration. While such effects might be the result of stimulus-seeking of distant information in the light, increased exploration times in the dark presumably reflect the processing of local information associated with the maze connectivity. These results suggest that exploratory patterns in the dark reflect processing of the topological structure of the maze.}

      \field{abstract}{The retrosplenial cortex supports navigation, with one role thought to be the integration of different spatial cue types. This hypothesis was extended by examining the integration of nonspatial cues. Rats with lesions in either the dysgranular subregion of retrosplenial cortex (area 30) or lesions in both the granular and dysgranular subregions (areas 29 and 30) were tested on cross-modal object recognition (Experiment 1). In these tests, rats used different sensory modalities when exploring and subsequently recognizing the same test objects. The objects were first presented either in the dark, i.e., giving tactile and olfactory cues, or in the light behind a clear Perspex barrier, i.e., giving visual cues. Animals were then tested with either constant combinations of sample and test conditions (light to light, dark to dark), or changed "cross-modal" combinations (light to dark, dark to light). In Experiment 2, visual object recognition was tested without Perspex barriers, but using objects that could not be distinguished in the dark. The dysgranular retrosplenial cortex lesions selectively impaired cross-modal recognition when cue conditions switched from dark to light between initial sampling and subsequent object recognition, but no impairment was seen when the cue conditions remained constant, whether dark or light. The combined (areas 29 and 30) lesioned rats also failed the dark to light cross-modal problem but this impairment was less selective. The present findings suggest a role for the dysgranular retrosplenial cortex in mediating the integration of information across multiple cue types, a role that potentially applies to both spatial and nonspatial domains.}

      \field{abstract}{The present study examined the consequences of retrosplenial cortex lesions in rats on two novel spatial tasks. In the first experiment, rats discriminated opposing room views from the same general location, along with their opposing directions of travel ('Perspective' task). Rats were trained with food rewards using a go/no-go design. Extensive retrosplenial cortex lesions involving both the granular and dysgranular areas impaired acquisition of this discrimination, which relied on distal visual cues. The same rats were then trained on a non-spatial go/no-go discrimination between different digging media. No lesion effect was apparent. In the final experiment, rats discriminated between two locations within a room ('Location' task) such that direction of travel at each location would be of less help in solving the problem. Both extensive retrosplenial lesions and selective dysgranular retrosplenial lesions impaired this Location task. These results highlight the importance of the retrosplenial cortex (areas 29 and 30), including the dysgranular cortex (area 30), for the effective use of distal visual cues to solve spatial problems. The findings, which help to explain the bias away from visual allocentric solutions that is shown by rats with retrosplenial cortex lesions when performing spatial tasks, also support the notion that the region assists the integration of different categories of visuospatial information.}

      \field{abstract}{The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been associated with diverse functions including attentional processes, visceromotor activity, decision making, goal directed behavior, and working memory. Using retrograde tracing techniques, we examined, compared, and contrasted afferent projections to the four divisions of the mPFC in the rat: the medial (frontal) agranular (AGm), anterior cingulate (AC), prelimbic (PL), and infralimbic (IL) cortices. Each division of the mPFC receives a unique set of afferent projections. There is a shift dorsoventrally along the mPFC from predominantly sensorimotor input to the dorsal mPFC (AGm and dorsal AC) to primarily 'limbic' input to the ventral mPFC (PL and IL). The AGm and dorsal AC receive afferent projections from widespread areas of the cortex (and associated thalamic nuclei) representing all sensory modalities. This information is presumably integrated at, and utilized by, the dorsal mPFC in goal directed actions. In contrast with the dorsal mPFC, the ventral mPFC receives significantly less cortical input overall and afferents from limbic as opposed to sensorimotor regions of cortex. The main sources of afferent projections to PL/IL are from the orbitomedial prefrontal, agranular insular, perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, the hippocampus, the claustrum, the medial basal forebrain, the basal nuclei of amygdala, the midline thalamus and monoaminergic nuclei of the brainstem. With a few exceptions, there are few projections from the hypothalamus to the dorsal or ventral mPFC. Accordingly, subcortical limbic information mainly reaches the mPFC via the midline thalamus and basal nuclei of amygdala. As discussed herein, based on patterns of afferent (as well as efferent) projections, PL is positioned to serve a direct role in cognitive functions homologous to dorsolateral PFC of primates, whereas IL appears to represent a visceromotor center homologous to the orbitomedial PFC of primates.}

      \field{abstract}{We used an operant delayed spatial alternation task to examine the role of rat dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) in spatial working memory. The task was designed to restrict movements during the delay period to minimize use of motor-mediating strategies. Inactivation of dmPFC (muscimol) resulted in increased errors and increased the temporal variability of responding. Animals did not show perseveration after errors (i.e., responding again at the erroneous location). Under control conditions, the time between spatial responses was greater and more variable before errors as compared to correct responses. These effects were eliminated when muscimol was infused into dmPFC. Trial outcome also affected movement and delay times in the next trial. This effect was diminished with muscimol in dmPFC. By contrast, when muscimol was infused in dorsal agranular insular cortex (AId)-a region that is strongly interconnected with dorsomedial prefrontal regions-there was no effect on delayed spatial alternation performance. These experiments confirm that dmPFC is necessary for successful delayed spatial alternation and establish that there is a relationship between response time variability and trial outcome that depends on dorsomedial prefrontal function.}

      \field{abstract}{It has been suggested that the role of the hippocampus for episodic memory is to selectively bind together item and contextual information. One such model, the Binding of Items and Context (BIC) model, proposed that the perirhinal cortex provides item and the postrhinal/parahippocampal cortex provides context to the hippocampus via the medial (MEC) and lateral entorhinal cortices (LEC) to be bound into an episodic representation. This model proposes that item and context information are stored and processed independently and in parallel before hippocampal processing. To evaluate this model, the present experiment evaluated the role of the MEC and LEC for item and contextual novelty detection. The present results suggest that excitotoxic lesions to the LEC primarily disrupt item novelty detection, whereas lesions to the MEC primarily disrupt contextual novelty detection. These data provide a functional double dissociation between the MEC and LEC across item and contextual processing. Despite this dissociation, the present results suggest that item and contextual information are not represented independently before hippocampal processing. These data support the basic assumptions of the BIC model, but suggest that item and context information may interact in the entorhinal cortex.}

      \field{abstract}{The differential contributions of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus for learning and memory have long been of interest. The present experiments were designed to evaluate the contributions of dorsal CA1 and ventral CA1 for temporal processing. Animals were run on three temporal ordering paradigms: one with visual objects, one with olfactory stimuli, and one with spatial locations. Animals with lesions to dorsal CA1 showed deficits for the temporal ordering of visual objects relative to control animals, and deficits for the temporal ordering of spatial locations relative to control and ventral CA1 lesioned animals. Animals with lesions to ventral CA1 showed deficits for the temporal ordering of olfactory information relative to control and dorsal CA1 lesioned animals, and a mild deficit for the temporal ordering of visual objects relative to control animals, but not as severe as those shown by the dorsal CA1 lesioned animals. These data suggest that dorsal CA1 and ventral CA1 contribute to temporal ordering processes, and that dorsal CA1 and ventral CA1 are dissociable for temporal ordering based upon the nature of the information that is processed.}

      \field{abstract}{It has been demonstrated that the dorsal CA1 subregion of the hippocampus mediates temporal processing of information, that dorsal CA3 participates in the spatiotemporal processing of memory, and the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG) mediates spatial pattern separation. A temporal ordering of spatial locations task was developed to test the role of the dorsal DG, CA3, and CA1 for the temporal processing of spatial information with either high or low levels of spatial interference. The results indicate that animals with DG lesions showed difficulty performing the task at high levels of spatial interference, but were able to perform the task well when there was low spatial interference. Animals with lesions to CA3 did not show a preference for either spatial location presented during the study phase during the preference test, suggesting impaired spatiotemporal processing. Animals with lesions to CA1 showed a preference for a later presented spatial location over the earlier, the opposite preference to that shown by control animals.}

The present experiment was designed to evaluate the role of each entorhinal efferent pathway into the dorsal hippocampus for detection of spatial and nonspatial (visual object) changes in the overall configuration of environmental stimuli. Dorsal dentate gyrus infusions of either APV or naloxone attenuated detection of a spatial change, whereas only naloxone infusions disrupted novel object detection. Either APV or naloxone infusions into dorsal CA3 disrupted both spatial and novel object detection. APV infusions into dorsal CA1 attenuated detection of a spatial change, whereas naloxone infusions into dorsal CA1 disrupted novel object detection. These data suggest that each dorsal hippocampal subregion processes spatial and nonspatial (visual object) information from perforant path efferents in a unique manner that is consistent with the intrinsic properties of each subregion.}

      \field{abstract}{The present experiments compared the performance of hippocampal-lesioned rats to control rats on a spatial continuous recognition task and an analogous nonspatial task with similar processing demands. Daily sessions for Experiment 1 involved sequential presentation of individual arms on a 12-arm radial maze. Each arm contained a Froot Loop reinforcement the first time it was presented, and latency to traverse the arm was measured. A subset of the arms were repeated, but did not contain reinforcement. Repeated arms were presented with lags ranging from 0 to 6 (0 to 6 different arm presentations occurred between the first and the repeated presentation). Difference scores were computed by subtracting the latency on first presentations from the latency on repeated presentations, and these scores were high in all rats prior to surgery, with a decreasing function across lag. There were no differences in performance following cortical control or sham surgery. However, there was a total deficit in performance following large electrolytic lesions of the hippocampus. The second experiment employed the same continuous recognition memory procedure, but used three-dimensional visual objects (toys, junk items, etc., in various shapes, sizes, and textures) as stimuli on a flat runway. As in Experiment 1, the stimuli were presented successively and latency to run to and move the object was measured. Objects were repeated with lags ranging from 0 to 4. Performance on this task following surgery did not differ from performance prior to surgery for either the control group or the hippocampal lesion group. These results provide support for Kesner's attribute model of hippocampal function in that the hippocampus is assumed to mediate data-based memory for spatial locations, but not three-dimensional visual objects.}

      \field{abstract}{Projections of the hippocampal formation to the prefrontal cortex were visualized in the rat by means of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. These projections distribute only to the prelimbic and the medial orbital cortices and arise exclusively from restricted portions of field CA1 of the Ammon's horn and the subiculum. The most dorsal portion of CA1 does not contribute fibers to this projection. In the subiculum, its origin is restricted to the proximal half, i.e., the portion that directly borders field CA1. Fibers from field CA1 and the subiculum have comparable distribution patterns in the prelimbic and medial orbital cortices. The density and distribution in the prefrontal cortex of the projections from the proximal portion of the subiculum depends on the location of the injections along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampal formation: the intermediate portion of the subiculum projects more densely and diffusely than its dorsal and ventral portions. In the prelimbic cortex, labeled fibers are present in all layers, showing marked morphological differences in deep versus superficial layers. In layers V and VI, most of the fibers are vertically oriented, while in layers II and III they are short and oriented towards the pial surface. Although no clear differences in terminal distribution were observed along the rostrocaudal extent of the prelimbic cortex, its dorsal and ventral portions show different innervation patterns. In the ventral portion of the prelimbic cortex, varicose fibers and terminal arborizations were present in all cortical layers, deep (V and VI) as well as superficial (II and III). In its dorsal part, the innervation was less dense and mostly present in the deep layers (V and VI). The fiber and terminal distribution in the medial orbital cortex was diffuse in all layers with a slight preference for layers deep to layer II.}

      \field{abstract}{Pyramidal cells in the rat hippocampus fire whenever the animal is in a particular place, suggesting that the hippocampus maintains a representation of the environment. Receptive fields of place cells (place fields) are largely determined by the distance of the rat from environmental walls. Because these walls are sometimes distinguishable only by their orientation with respect to the outside room, it has been hypothesised that a polarising directional input enables the cells to locate their fields off-centre in an otherwise symmetrical environment. We tested this hypothesis by gaining control of the rat's internal directional sense, independently of other cues, to see whether manipulating this sense could, by itself, produce a corresponding alteration in place field orientation. Place cells were recorded while rats foraged in a rectangular box, in the absence or presence of external room cues. With room cues masked, slow rotation of the rat and the box together caused the fields to rotate accordingly. Rotating the recording box alone by 180 degrees rarely caused corresponding field rotation, while rotating the rat alone 180 degrees outside the environment and then replacing it in the recording box almost always resulted in a corresponding rotation of the fields. This shows that place field orientation can be controlled by controlling the internal direction-sense of the rat, and it opens the door to psycho-physical exploration of the sensory basis of the direction sense. When room cues were present, distal visual cues predominated over internal cues in establishing place field orientation.}

      \field{abstract}{Intradentate injection of colchicine is one of the techniques used to destroy granule cells. This study compared the behavioral effects of various amounts of colchicine (1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 microg; Col 1, Col 3, and Col 6, respectively) injected into the dentate gyrus of adult Long-Evans male rats. Starting 10 days after lesion surgery, behavioral testing assessed home-cage and open-field locomotion, alternation in a T-maze, water-maze, and radial-maze learning according to protocols placing emphasis on reference, and working memory. All of these tasks are sensitive to hippocampal disruption. Histological verifications showed that the extent of the lesions depends on the dose of colchicine (index of dentate gyrus shrinkage: -33\% in Col 1, -54\% in Col 3, and -67\% in Col 6 rats). Colchicine dose-dependently increased nocturnal home cage activity (an effect found 10 days but not 5 months after surgery), but had no significant effect on open-field locomotion or T-maze alternation. A dose-dependent reference memory impairment was found during the acquisition of spatial navigation in the water maze; Col 3 and Col 6 rats were more impaired than Col 1 rats. During the probe trial (platform removed), control rats spent a longer distance swimming over the platform area than all rats with colchicine lesions. In the working memory version of the test, all rats with colchicine lesions showed significant deficits. The deficits were larger in Col 3 and Col 6 rats compared to Col 1 rats. The lesions had no effect on swimming speed. In the radial-maze test, there was also a dose-dependent working memory impairment. However, reference memory was disrupted in a manner that did not differ among the three groups of lesioned rats. Our data are in line with the view that the dentate gyrus plays an important role in the acquisition of new information and is an integral neural substrate for spatial reference and spatial working memory. They also suggest that damage to granule cells might have more pronounced effects on reference than on working memory in the radial maze. Finally, they demonstrate that part of the variability in the conclusions from previous experiments concerning the role of granule cells in cognitive processes, particularly in spatial learning and memory, may be due to the type of tests used and/or the extent of the damage produced.}

      \field{abstract}{The majority of research regarding contextual learning and memory has focused on the contributions of the hippocampus and related medial temporal lobe structures. However, little is known about other possible cortical contributions to these processes. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that electrolytic lesions of the retrosplenial cortex (RSP), a posterior region of cingulate cortex, impaired contextual but not cue-specific fear conditioning. The present experiments further examined the role of RSP in contextual fear memory using fiber-sparing neurotoxic lesions and both signaled and unsignaled fear conditioning paradigms. Despite comparable acquisition of the conditioned fear response, rats with neurotoxic lesions of RSP exhibited impaired contextual memory relative to control animals in both the signaled and unsignaled paradigms. These results further suggest an important role for RSP in contextual learning and memory.}

      \field{abstract}{Mounting evidence indicates that the retrosplenial cortex (RSP) has a critical role in spatial navigation. The goal of the present study was to characterize the specific nature of spatial memory deficits that are observed following damage to RSP. Rats with RSP lesions or sham lesions were first trained in a working memory task using an 8-arm radial arm maze. Rats were allowed 5min to visit each arm and retrieve food pellets and a 5-s delay was imposed between arm choices. Consistent with previous research, rats with RSP damage committed more errors than controls. In particular, RSP-lesioned rats committed more errors of omission (failing to visit an arm of the maze), but there were no lesion effects on errors of commission (revisiting an arm). Neither group of rats exhibited a turn bias (i.e., always turning a certain direction when choosing an arm). At the end of the training phase of the experiment, both groups had reached asymptote and committed very few errors. In the subsequent test phase, a longer delay (30-s) was imposed during some sessions. Both control and RSP-lesioned rats continued to make few errors during sessions with the standard 5-s delay, but RSP-lesioned rats were impaired at the 30-s delay and committed more errors of commission, consistent with an increase in taxing spatial working memory.}

      \field{abstract}{Animals with sham-operations or medial prefrontal cortex lesions were trained in a task which required memory for short or long lists of items (spatial locations). On any one trial a rat is presented with 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 items (spatial locations) on a 12-arm radial maze followed 15 min later by a win-shift test comprising a choice between a place previously visited and a novel place. Sham-operated animals showed an increase in errors as a function of set size (2 to 8 items) followed by a decrease in errors with a set size of 10 items suggesting the use of both retrospective and prospective memory codes. In contrast, animals with medial prefrontal cortex lesions made most of their errors for the longest list length reflecting an inability to shift from a retrospective to prospective memory code. The results are interpreted as support for a medial prefrontal cortex role in mediating a prospective code perhaps via knowledge systems based on temporal information.}

      \field{abstract}{The neurobiology of the attribute model of memory suggests that that there are potential interactions between the hippocampus and parietal cortex (PC) during learning, consolidation, and retrieval of spatial but not nonspatial information. In addition, the model suggests that there are double dissociations between the hippocampus and PC with respect to the intrinsic processes of spatial perceptual memory and spatial short-term or working memory. Data are presented that support both suggestions. There is a good possibility that spatial information is initially processed in parallel in the hippocampus and PC, followed by transfer of spatial information from the hippocampus to the PC for subsequent long-term storage.}

      \field{abstract}{From a behavioral perspective, the CA3a,b subregion of the hippocampus plays an important role in the encoding of new spatial information within short-term memory with a duration of seconds and minutes. This can easily be observed in tasks that require rapid encoding, novelty detection, one-trial short-term or working memory, and one-trial cued recall primarily for spatial information. These are tasks that have been assumed to reflect the operations of episodic memory and require interactions between CA3a,b and the dentate gyrus (DG) via mossy fiber inputs into the CA3a,b. The CA3a,b is also important for encoding of spatial information requiring the acquisition of arbitrary and relational associations. All these tasks are assumed to operate within an autoassociative network function of the CA3 region. The CA3a,b also supports retrieval of short-term memory information based on a spatial pattern completion process. Based on afferent inputs into CA3a,b from the DG via mossy fibers and afferents from the entorhinal cortex into CA3a,b as well as reciprocal connections with the septum, CA3a,b can bias the process of encoding utilizing the operation of spatial pattern separation and the process of retrieval utilizing the operation of pattern completion. The CA3a,b also supports sequential processing of information in cooperation with CA1 based on the Schaffer collateral output from CA3a,b to CA1. The CA3c function is in part based on modulation of the DG in supporting pattern separation processes.}

      \field{abstract}{In this review article the emphasis will be on the role of the DG (dorsal and ventral) in supporting memory based on the operation of specific processes. Based on the development of computational models of dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) and behavioral evidence based on dysfunction of dDG, this review will show that the dDG mediates mnemonic processing of spatial information. The processes subserved by dDG include (a) the operation of conjunctive encoding of multiple sensory inputs, implying an integration of sensory inputs to determine a spatial representation, and (b) pattern separation of spatial (especially metric) information, involving the reduction of interference between similar spatial locations (c) pattern separation of context (d) importance of context in object recognition, and (e) temporal integration and remote memory and spatial pattern separation based in part on neurogenesis. In addition the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG) mediates mnemonic processing of odor information as indicated by odor pattern separation.}

      \field{abstract}{Based on behavioral procedures aimed at measuring working or data-based memory for spatial location, response, and visual object information, it is shown that there is a triple dissociation among the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and extrastriate visual cortex in mediating spatial location, response, and visual object information, respectively. The hippocampus appears to subserve only spatial location, the caudate nucleus only response, and the extrastriate visual cortex only visual object information. The results support the neurobiological foundation of the attribute memory model.}

      \field{abstract}{While it is acknowledged that species specific differences are an implicit condition of comparative studies, rodent models of prefrontal function serve a significant role in the acquisition of converging evidence on prefrontal function across levels of analysis and research techniques. The purpose of the present review is to examine whether the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in rats supports a variety of processes associated with executive function including working memory, temporal processing, planning (prospective coding), flexibility, rule learning, and decision making. Therefore, in this review we examined changes associated with working memory processes for spatial locations, visual objects, odors, tastes, and response domains or attributes, temporal processes including temporal order, sequence learning, prospective coding, behavioral flexibility associated with reversal learning and set shifting, paired associate learning, and decision making based on effort, time discounting, and uncertainty following damage to the PFC in rats. In addition, potential parallel processes of executive function in monkeys and humans based on several theories of subregional differentiation within the PFC will be presented. Specifically, theories based on domain or attribute specificity (Goldman-Rakic, 1996), level of processing (Petrides, 1996), rule learning based on complexity (Wise, Murray, \& Gerfen, 1996), executive functions based on connectivity with other brain regions associated with top-down control (Miller \& Cohen, 2001), are presented and applied to PFC function in rats with the aim of understanding subregional specificity in the rat PFC. The data suggest that there is subregional specificity within the PFC of rats, monkey and humans and there are parallel cognitive functions of the different subregions of the PFC in rats, monkeys and humans.}

      \field{abstract}{Rats were trained on an eight-arm radial maze task using a procedure that provides for an assessment of both working and reference memory. Following training, rats received parietal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, visual cortex, or nucleus basalis magnocellularis lesions. Rats with visual cortex lesions showed no change in performance on either working or reference memory. Rats with parietal cortex lesions displayed a temporary deficit in reference, but no deficit on working memory. Animals with medial prefrontal cortex lesions showed a temporary deficit on both working and reference memory. Rats with extensive lateral frontal and parietal cortex depletion of acetylcholinesterase following nucleus basalis magnocellularis lesions had a marked disruption only of reference but not of working memory. It is concluded that neocortex and possibly the cholinergic projections to neocortex play an important role in mediating reference memory.}

      \field{abstract}{Using a continuous recognition memory procedure for spatial location information, rats were given sequential presentation of individual arms on a 12-arm maze. Each arm contained a Froot Loop reinforcement the first time it was presented, and latency to traverse the arm was measured. A subset of the arms were repeated, but did not contain reinforcement. Repeated arms were presented with lags ranging from zero to six (from zero to six different arm presentations occurred between the first and repeated presentation). After completion of acquisition training (significantly longer latencies for repeated arms in comparison with the first presentation of an arm), rats received lesions of the medial or lateral entorhinal cortex, pre- and parasubiculum, or served as sham-operated controls. Based on continued postsurgery training and additional tests, the results indicated that rats with pre- and parasubiculum or pre- and parasubiculum plus medial entorhinal cortex produced sustained impairment in performing the task. Medial or lateral entorhinal cortex and control lesions did not display any sustained deficits. The data suggest that working memory for spatial location information is mediated primarily by the pre- and parasubiculum, but not medial entorhinal and lateral entorhinal cortex.}

      \field{abstract}{This experiment tested the theory that the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus mediates episodic learning of arbitrary associations. The authors developed 2 tasks based on the episodic flavor-place paired-associate task described by M. Day, R. Langston, and R. G. Morris (2003): an object-cued spatial location recall task and a spatial location-cued object recall task. After rats were trained to a criterion of 80\% correct on 1 of the 2 tasks, they received either a dorsal CA3 lesion or a vehicle control lesion. Control animals continued performing well on both tasks. Rats with lesions to dorsal CA3 were impaired on both tasks and performed at chance but were able to perform a nonepisodic version of the task as a control. These data suggest that CA3 mediates episodic learning of arbitrary associations as tested in the 1-trial object-cued spatial location recall and spatial location-cued object recall tasks.}

      \field{abstract}{In the first experiment, rats were trained on a working memory task for a spatial response (right-left turn) information using a delayed matching-to-sample procedure. Following lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPF), which includes anterior cingulate and medial precentral cortex, there was a profound working memory deficit even at the shortest delay. In the second experiment, rats were trained on a working memory task for spatial location information using a delayed matching-to-sample procedure. Following lesions of the MPF, there was only a mild working memory deficit, whereas following dorsal hippocampal lesions there was a profound working memory deficit even at the shortest delay. In the third experiment, rats were trained on a working memory task for visual object information using a delayed nonmatching-to-sample procedure. Following lesions of the MPF, there were no working memory deficits, whereas following lesions of the prelimbic and infralimbic cortex there was a profound working memory deficit even at the shortest delay. The results suggest that different neural subregions of the prefrontal cortex mediate working memory for specific attribute information.}

      \field{abstract}{The purpose of this review is to determine whether specific subregions (dentate gyrus [DG], CA3, and CA1) of the hippocampus provide unique contributions to specific processes associated with intrinsic information processing exemplified by novelty detection, encoding, pattern separation, pattern association, pattern completion, retrieval, short-term memory and intermediate-term memory. Based on anatomical neural network organization, electrophysiology of cellular activity, lesions, early gene activation, and computational modeling, it can be shown that there exists extensive cooperation among the three subregions of the hippocampus, but there also exists reliable specificity of function for each of the subregions of the hippocampus. The primary process supported by the DG subregion of the hippocampus can be characterized by orthogonalization of sensory inputs to create a metric spatial representation. Furthermore the DG participates in conjunction with CA3 in supporting spatial pattern separation. The CA3 subregion of the hippocampus supports processes associated with spatial pattern association, spatial pattern completion, novelty detection, and short-term memory. The CA1 subregion of the hippocampus supports processes associated with temporal pattern association, temporal pattern completion, and intermediate-term memory. Furthermore, the CA3 in conjunction with CA1 supports temporal pattern separation. All the above-mentioned processes are assumed to reflect intrinsic processing of information within the hippocampus. The diversity of functions associated with the different subregions of the hippocampus suggests that one should not treat the hippocampus as a single entity, but rather that one should concentrate on elucidating further the functions of both dorsal and ventral subregions of the hippocampus and pathways that directly connect each of the subregions as well as their connections with the entorhinal cortex.}

Rats with AC-PC lesions acquired the task as readily as controls. In contrast, the PL-IL lesioned rats did not learn the task. Whenever higher order processing is required to solve a task, the data support an attribute-specificity model of prefrontal cortex function in that the PL-IL cortices support both object and place attribute information in a variety of tasks including object-place paired associate learning.}

      \field{abstract}{Theoretical models of the CA3 suggest that because of its architecture, it mediates spatial pattern completion and working memory processes. The aim of this study was to determine whether with the use of drugs to block neurotransmitter action in CA3 one can separate the operation of these two processes using a visual-spatial pattern completion task for multiple cues. Rats were trained on a cheeseboard apparatus with a black curtain containing four extramaze cues. In the study phase rats removed a black block from one of 15 food wells and then after a 10- or 30-s delay in the test phase they had to return to the food well in the absence of the black block. After reaching criterion performance cannulae were bilaterally implanted into the CA3 of the rats. Rats were then given AP5, naloxone, or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and following the standard study phase they were given the test phase with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 cues removed. The mean degree of error in all drugs and all cue conditions was recorded. Overall spatial inaccuracy was recorded in rats under the AP5 30-s delay condition, whereas deficits were contingent upon the number of cues available under all naloxone conditions. Results show that the blockage of glutamate via AP5 inhibited short-term or working memory, whereas the blockage of mu-opioids via naloxone disrupted visual-spatial pattern completion.}

      \field{abstract}{Emotional responses such as fear are rapidly acquired through classical conditioning. This report examines the neural substrate underlying memory of acquired fear. Rats were classically conditioned to fear both tone and context through the use of aversive foot shocks. Lesions were made in the hippocampus either 1, 7, 14, or 28 days after training. Contextual fear was abolished in the rats that received lesions 1 day after fear conditioning. However, rats for which the interval between learning and hippocampal lesions was longer retained significant contextual fear memory. In the same animals, lesions did not affect fear response to the tone at any time. These results indicate that fear memory is not a single process and that the hippocampus may have a time-limited role in associative fear memories evoked by polymodal (contextual) but not unimodal (tone) sensory stimuli.}

      \field{abstract}{Studies of spatial behavior in both the human and non-human primate have generally focused on the role of the posterior parietal and prefrontal cortices and have indicated that destruction of these regions produce allocentric and egocentric deficits, respectively. The present study examined the role of the rodent analogs of these regions, the posterior parietal (PPC) and medial agranular (AGm) cortices, in egocentric and allocentric spatial processing, and whether spatial processing in rodents is organized in a hemispatial and/or lateralized manner as has been found in the primate. Eighty male rats receiving either a unilateral or bilateral lesion of AGm or PPC were examined on an egocentric (adjacent arm) or an allocentric (cheeseboard) maze task. The results indicated that PPC and AGm have dissociable spatial functions. Bilateral AGm destruction resulted in egocentric spatial deficits, and unilateral AGm operates demonstrated an intermediate deficit. In contrast, bilateral PPC operates demonstrated a severe deficit in allocentric processing. In addition, there were lateralized differences in the performance of unilateral PPC operates. While right PPC lesions resulted in a significant deficit on the allocentric task, no such deficit was seen in left PPC operates. In addition, neither unilateral AGm nor unilateral PPC operates demonstrated a hemispatial impairment on either the egocentric or allocentric tasks.}

      \field{abstract}{Based on computational models of the hippocampus, it has been suggested that a possible mechanism for memory retrieval is pattern completion, wherein an autoassociative network recalls previous patterns of activity given noisy or degraded cues. However, there are few behavioral data examining pattern completion per se in the hippocampus. Here, we present a study in which rats were tested on a spatial location retrieval paradigm, each trial of which consisted of a sample and choice phase. During the sample phase, rats were trained to displace an object in one of 15 possible locations to retrieve a food reward and return to the start-box on a cheeseboard maze. The object was then removed and the same location was re-baited for the choice phase. The rats' accuracy in returning to the correct location was recorded. On test trials, visual extramaze cues, vestibular cues, or both were manipulated to assess pattern completion in normal rats. Subjects were then randomly assigned to receive a cortical control, a sham, or a dorsal and ventral hippocampal lesion and were retested on the task. Control and unoperated rats were able to perform the task when visual extramaze or vestibular cues were reliable, but not when they were manipulated. Rats with hippocampal lesions were impaired in the baseline condition, as well as during all manipulations. These results support the hypothesis that the hippocampus supports the retrieval of a spatial location, possibly through a process of pattern completion.}

      \field{abstract}{Rats with lesions of the medial prefrontal, posterior parietal, or posterior temporal cortex were tested in five spatial navigation tasks, which varied in egocentric or allocentric demands, a visual discrimination task, and two delayed nonmatching-to-sample tasks. Rats with prefrontal lesions were impaired at every spatial navigation task, whereas rats with posterior parietal lesions had selective spatial navigation impairments. Rats with prefrontal lesions were also impaired at a visual delayed nonmatching-to-sample task, as they were unable to learn the task, even with no delay. The results are consistent with the idea that the basic plan of mammalian cortex includes prefrontal, posterior parietal, and posterior temporal regions, each of which have generally similar functions across mammalian taxa. There are, however, species-typical differences that reflect specific ecological pressures on the development of the different regions.}

      \field{abstract}{Rats with lesions of the medial frontal, orbital frontal, or parietal cortex were compared behaviorally with rats with complete removal of the neocortex and normal control rats on three spatial tasks: Morris water task, radial arm maze, and spatial reversals in a Grice box. Decortication produced severe impairments in the acquisition of all three tasks, thus providing a measure against which to compare the severity of the impairments observed following more restricted removals. Rats with parietal cortex lesions were relatively unimpaired at any of the tasks, although they had a significant deficit on the spatial reversal task and had a short-term memory impairment on the radial arm maze. In contrast, rats with medial frontal lesions had a significant, but relatively mild, impairment on the radial arm maze and were very poor at learning the water task. Rats with orbital frontal lesions were nearly as impaired on the radial arm maze and water task as decorticate rats. The results suggest that the frontal and parietal cortex of rats play different roles in the control of spatial orientation but do not support the view that egocentric and allocentric spatial orientation are related to frontal and parietal mechanisms, respectively. In addition, the results suggest that the frontal cortex plays a larger role in the control of spatially guided behavior than has been previously recognized and that both the medial frontal and the orbital (sulcal) frontal cortex play a dissociable role in the control of spatial orientation.}

      \field{abstract}{Primates have an area of posterior cortex characterized by multimodal sensory projections to and from the frontal association cortex and a clear behavioural syndrome resulting from lesions to this zone. The posterior association cortex of the rat was examined in two series of experiments, one anatomical and one behavioural, to see if an analogous region could be found. The anatomical connections of Krieg's area 7 in the rat were examined by placing the retrograde tracer, True blue, into the frontal or posterior cortex, and the behaviour of rats with this cortex removed was studied on a variety of tasks. This area appears to be a multimodal sensory association region. It receives projections from striate (area 17), extrastriate (areas 18a and 18b), and somatosensory cortex (area 3). It is also reciprocally connected with the posterior cingulate cortex and two frontal association zones in the medial frontal cortex, namely the anterior cingulate cortex and the frontal eye fields. Lesions produced deficits on tasks of tactile discrimination, and walking a narrow beam, two tasks requiring animals to navigate accurately to a point in space, and a task requiring the association of two spatially discontiguous cues. The animals were not impaired at navigating to a cue or in opening puzzle latches. Overall, the results show that the rat has a sensory association zone that may be analogous to the posterior parietal cortex of primates.}

      \field{abstract}{The structures forming the medial temporal lobe appear to be necessary for the establishment of long-term declarative memory. In particular, they may be involved in the "consolidation" of information in higher-order associational cortices, perhaps through feedback projections. This review highlights the fact that the medial temporal lobe is organized as a hierarchy of associational networks. Indeed, associational connections within the perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices enables a significant amount of integration of unimodal and polymodal inputs, so that only highly integrated information reaches the remainder of the hippocampal formation. The feedback efferent projections from the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices to the neocortex largely reciprocate the afferent projections from the neocortex to these areas. There are, however, noticeable differences in the degree of reciprocity of connections between the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices and certain areas of the neocortex, in particular in the frontal and temporal lobes. These observations are particularly important for models of hippocampal-neocortical interaction and long-term storage of information in the neocortex. Furthermore, recent functional studies suggest that the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices are more than interfaces for communication between the neocortex and the hippocampal formation. These structures participate actively in memory processes, but the precise role they play in the service of memory or other cognitive functions is currently unclear.}

      \field{abstract}{Previous literature suggests that the hippocampus subserves processes associated with the encoding of novel information. To investigate the role of different subregions of the hippocampus, the authors made neurotoxic lesions in different subregions of the dorsal hippocampus (i.e., CA1, dentate gyrus [DG], or CA3) of rats, followed by tests using a spontaneous object exploration paradigm. All lesion groups explored normally an object newly introduced in a familiar location. However, when some of the familiar objects were moved to novel locations, both DG and CA3 lesion groups were severely impaired in reexploring the displaced objects, whereas the CA1 lesion group was only mildly impaired in reexploration. The results suggest that the DG-CA3 network is essential in detecting novelty for spatial, but not for individual object, information.}

      \field{abstract}{Axon-sparing neurotoxic lesions of CA1 or CA3 were produced in the dorsal hippocampus to test dissociative lesion effects on spatial working memory for sequential items. Rats were required to remember four different sections sequentially presented on a newly devised maze (i.e., Tulum maze) during a study phase. Each section was cued by a unique object that was specifically associated with each location within the section during the study phase. Following a 15-s delay and during the test phase, rats were required to revisit the location within a section randomly chosen among the previously visited sections in the absence of the cued object. Both CA1 and CA3 lesions similarly disrupted accurate relocation of a previously visited place. However, differential effects of the CA1 and CA3 lesions were observed in serial position curves. CA3-lesions disrupted performance for the first three serial positions, but did not disrupt performance for the last serial position (recency). In contrast, CA1-lesions disrupted performance for all serial positions. The results suggest that temporal separation of spatial memory may depend on the conjoint function of CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus with a disruption of a spatial pattern completion process following CA3 lesions and a disruption of a temporal pattern separation process following a CA1 lesion.}

      \field{abstract}{N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in the mammalian hippocampus is essential for learning and memory. Although computational models and anatomical studies have emphasized functional differences among hippocampal subregions, subregional specificity of NMDA receptor function is largely unknown. Here we present evidence that NMDA receptors in CA3 are required in a situation in which spatial representation needs to be reorganized, whereas the NMDA receptors in CA1 and/or the dentate gyrus are more involved in acquiring memory that needs to be retrieved after a delay period exceeding a short-term range. Our data, with data from CA1-specific knockout mice, suggest the possibility of heterogeneous mnemonic function of NMDA receptors in different subregions of the hippocampus.}

Lesions of the dentate gyrus or the CA3, but not the CA1, subregion of the hippocampus induced a deficit in the acquisition of the task with short-term delays (i.e., 10 sec) and impaired performance of the task in a novel environment. All subregional lesions produced sustained impairment in performing the task with intermediate-term delays (i.e., 5 min) when rats were tested in a familiar environment. The results suggest a dynamic interaction among the dorsal hippocampal subregions in processing spatial working memory, with the time window (i.e., delay) of a task recognized as an essential controlling factor.}

      \field{abstract}{The prefrontal cortex and the dorsal hippocampus have been studied extensively for their significant roles in spatial working memory. A possible time-dependent functional relationship between the prefrontal cortex and the dorsal hippocampus in spatial working memory was tested. A combined lesion and pharmacological inactivation technique targeting both the dorsal hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex was used (i.e., axon-sparing lesions of the dorsal hippocampus combined with reversible inactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex, or vice versa, within a subject). A delayed nonmatching-to-place task on a radial eight-arm maze with short-term (i.e., 10 sec) versus intermediate-term (i.e., 5 min) delays was used as a behavioral paradigm. Here we report that the dorsal hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex process short-term spatial memory in parallel, serving as a compensatory mechanism for each other. The role of the dorsal hippocampus, however, becomes highlighted as the time-window for memory (i.e., delay) shifts from short-term to a delay period (i.e., intermediate-term) exceeding the short-term range. The results indicate that the time window of memory is a key factor in dissociating multiple memory systems.}

      \field{abstract}{Computational theories have suggested different functions for the hippocampal subfields (e.g., CA1 and CA3) in memory. However, it has been difficult to find dissociations relevant to these hypothesized functions in investigations of the hippocampal correlates of space ("place fields") in freely behaving animals. The current study demonstrates a double dissociation between the shifts in the center of mass (COM) of the place fields that were simultaneously recorded in CA1 and CA3 when familiar cue configurations were dynamically changed over days. The COM of CA3 place fields shifted backward in the first experience of the cue-changed environment, whereas the COM of CA1 place fields did not display the backward shift until the next day. These results support the hypothesis that CA3 plays a key role in the rapid formation of representations of new spatiotemporal sequences, whereas CA1 may be more important for comparing currently experienced sequence information with stored sequences in the CA3 network.}

      \field{abstract}{Although the roles of both the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have been suggested in a spatial paired-associate memory task, both areas were investigated separately in prior studies. The current study investigated the relative contributions of the hippocampus and mPFC to spatial paired-associate learning within a single behavioral paradigm. In a novel behavioral task, a pair of different objects appeared repeatedly across trials, but in different arms in a radial maze, and different rules were associated with those arms for reward. Specifically, in an "object-in-place" arm, the rat was required to choose a particular object associated with the arm. In a "location-in-place" arm, the animal was required to choose a certain within-arm location (ignoring the object occupying the location). Compared to normal animals, rats with ibotenic acid-based lesions in the hippocampus showed an irrecoverable impairment in performance in both object-in-place and location-in-place arms. When the mPFC was inactivated by muscimol (GABA(A) receptor agonist) in the normal animals with intact hippocampi, they showed the same severe impairment as seen in the hippocampal lesioned rats only in object-in-place arms. The results confirm that the hippocampus is necessary for a biconditional paired-associate task when space is a critical component. The mPFC, however, is more selectively involved in the object-place paired-associate task than in the location-place paired-associate task. The current task powerfully demonstrates an experimental situation in which both the hippocampus and mPFC are required and may serve as a useful paradigm for investigating the neural mechanisms of object-place association.}

      \field{abstract}{"Boundary vector cells" were predicted to exist by computational models of the environmental inputs underlying the spatial firing patterns of hippocampal place cells (O'Keefe and Burgess, 1996; Burgess et al., 2000; Hartley et al., 2000). Here, we report the existence of cells fulfilling this description in recordings from the subiculum of freely moving rats. These cells may contribute environmental information to place cell firing, complementing path integrative information. Their relationship to other cell types, including medial entorhinal "border cells," is discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{The hippocampus plays an important role in the declarative or explicit memory in humans and is necessary for allocentric spatial learning and olfactory memory in animals. In primates and rodents, the bilateral hemispheres of the brain (especially the forebrain) symmetrically and asymmetrically contribute to diverse cognitive manipulations. In this study, we investigated the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory and in odor-paired associate memory by unilaterally or bilaterally lesioning this region in rats. The bilateral removal, but not the unilateral removal, of the hippocampus impaired both the acquisition of spatial working memory in the radial maze task and the retrieval of maze performance tested 1 month after the acquisition trials. In contrast, neither bilateral nor unilateral removal impaired the odor-paired associate learning. These findings suggest that the hippocampus is critical to the spatial memory, and that a unilateral hippocampus is sufficient for executing a spatial task. The present results also indicate that the hippocampus plays a minor role in odor-dominated associate learning and that some kinds of memories in rats may be processed independently by the left or right hippocampus.}

Lesioned rats were severely impaired relative to controls in both the reference and working memory versions of the water maze task and displayed a delay-dependent deficit in a delayed nonmatch to place procedure conducted in the T-maze. Lesioned rats also displayed reduced exploration in a novel environment, and performance was altered in an object recognition procedure as compared with the control group.

      \field{abstract}{To determine what influence the pre- and parasubiculum regions of the hippocampal formation have on neural representations within the dorsal hippocampus, single-unit recordings were made as rats with bilateral ibotenic acid lesions centered on the former regions (n = 4) or control surgeries (n = 3) foraged freely. Spatial firing specificity was measured using an information content procedure. Cells from lesioned animals (n = 57) provided significantly less spatial information than cells from control animals (n = 44). Whereas some degree of location-related activity (place fields) was observed in 98\% of neurons recorded from control animals, it was observed in only 65\% of the neurons from lesioned animals. The spatial resolution of the intact place fields appeared to be compromised in lesioned animals as a result of their having a higher firing rate outside the place field. These findings indicate that the pre- and parasubiculum regions have a major role in maintaining the specificity of the place field firing of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Since previous data indicate that these lesioned animals displayed delay-dependent deficits in spatial tasks, these findings also suggest that a disruption in place field activity may be a causal factor in this spatial memory deficit.}

      \field{abstract}{To test for the contribution of the parietal cortex and hippocampus to memory for allocentric spatial cues, the authors trained rats on a go/no-go task that required the rat to remember the distance between two visual cues. Total hippocampal lesions impaired working-memory representation for allocentric distance, whereas parietal cortex lesions resulted in only a transient impairment. In a second experiment, neither hippocampal nor parietal cortex lesions impaired allocentric distance discrimination. A third experiment showed that both the dorsal and ventral areas of the hippocampal formation must be destroyed to impair working memory for allocentric distance information. There appears to be a dissociation between the hippocampus and parietal cortex in mediating memory for allocentric distance information.}

To assess the reference memory system, and to serve as a control for nonmemory deficits, successive discrimination go/no-go tasks were then conducted using the same rats. Rats with hippocampal, but not parietal cortex, lesions were impaired relative to controls in the working memory (DMTS) task for both egocentric distance and place information, although the deficit observed in the working memory task for egocentric distance information by rats with hippocampal lesions was mild. Neither hippocampal nor parietal cortex lesioned rats were impaired relative to controls in the reference memory (successive discrimination) task for either cue.

      \field{abstract}{The role of the basolateral amygdala (LA) in the acquisition and expression of Pavlovian fear conditioning was examined in 80 rats. Excitotoxic lesions were made in the BLA using N-methyl-D-aspartate 7 days before or 1, 14, or 28 days after Pavlovian fear conditioning. Conditioning consisted of three pairings of a tone with an aversive footshock in a novel chamber, and freezing behavior served as an index of conditional fear. BLA lesions abolished conditional freezing to both the contextual and acoustic conditional stimuli at all training-to-lesion intervals, and the magnitude of the impairment did not vary as a function of the training-to-lesion interval. Reacquisition training elevated levels of freezing in rats with BLA lesions but did not reduce the magnitude of their deficit in relation to that of controls. These results reveal that neurons in the BLA have an enduring role in the expression of conditional fear.}

      \field{abstract}{One fundamental function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is to guide context-appropriate behaviour in situations of response conflict. Haddon and Killcross recently developed a task in rats which mimics some aspects of response conflict seen in human cognitive paradigms such as the Stroop task. Using this paradigm they demonstrated that large PFC lesions including the prelimbic (PL), infralimbic (IL) and anterior cingulate cortices (ACC) selectively impaired performance on incongruent trials which required the use of task-setting contextual cues to control responding in the face of ambiguous response information. The current experiment was conducted to determine whether specific PFC regions were responsible for the deficit in incongruent performance. Rats were trained on two instrumental biconditional discriminations, one auditory and one visual, in two different contexts. Following acquisition, rats were implanted with guide cannulae aimed at the PL or the IL cortices of the rat prefrontal cortex. Following retraining, rats received microinfusions of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) into either the PL or the IL prior to presentations of novel congruent and incongruent audiovisual compounds of the training stimuli in extinction. Results showed that temporary inactivation of the PL cortex led to a selective deficit on incongruent compound trials, but left congruent, and hence biconditional task performance intact. By contrast, IL inactivation had no effect on the accuracy of responding during either congruent or incongruent trials. These results suggest that the PL cortex is necessary for the use of task-setting contextual cues to control responding to conflicting information.}

      \field{abstract}{Monosynaptic perforant path projections to the CA3 region of the hippocampus are anatomically and physiologically substantial pathways that relay cortical input directly to the hippocampus proper. Despite the suggested relevance of these direct pathways in models of information processing within the CA3 region, surprisingly few studies have characterized synaptic plasticity in these direct cortical projections to the CA3 region. We assessed the ability of perforant path projections, and commissural/associational projections to the hippocampal CA3 region to both induce or display associative LTP in vivo. In pentobarbital-anesthetized adult rats, trains delivered to either the medial or lateral perforant pathway at current intensities normally insufficient to induce LTP displayed associative LTP when these same trains were delivered in conjunction with high-intensity trains to the alternate perforant pathway. Similarly, associative LTP is induced at intrinsic commissural/associational-CA3 (C/A-CA3) synapses when weak C/A trains were delivered in conjunction with high-intensity trains to either the medial or lateral perforant pathway. Associative LTP also was observed at medial and lateral perforant path-CA3 synapses when weak perforant path trains were tetanized in conjunction with high-intensity trains delivered to C/A-CA3 synapses. Thus direct perforant path-CA3 synapses and commissural/associational-CA3 synapses can modify and be modified by other CA3 afferents in an associative manner, verifying a requirement for synaptic plasticity explicit in models of autoassociative information processing in the CA3 region.}

      \field{abstract}{It has been demonstrated previously that lesions to medial prefrontal cortex in rats impair the shifting of attentional set between perceptual features of complex stimuli [J. Neurosci. 20 (2000) 4320], a result that mirrors the deficit found in humans and monkeys [Nature 380 (1996) 69; Behav. Neurosci. 110 (1996) 872; J. Neurosci. 17 (1997) 9285; Neuropsychologia 29 (1991) 993]. These data imply functional homology between rat medial prefrontal cortex and primate prefrontal cortex.In marmoset monkeys, there is a double dissociation between the effects of lesions of lateral prefrontal cortex, which impair shifting of attentional set, and lesions of orbital prefrontal cortex, which result in impairments of reversal of stimulus-reward contingencies, leaving attentional set-shifting capacities intact [Nature 380 (1996) 69; Behav. Neurosci. 110 (1996) 872; J. Neurosci. 17 (1997) 9285]. The present investigation examined whether lesions to rat orbital prefrontal cortex would produce deficits in reversal learning in the absence of deficits in shifting attentional set, as seen in monkeys. Rats were trained to perform an attentional set-shifting task that is formally the same as that used in monkeys and humans. In a single session, rats performed a series of discriminations, including acquisitions and reversals. Damage to orbital prefrontal cortex in the rats did not disrupt the ability to acquire, maintain or shift attentional set. We report here the same selective impairment in reversal learning in rats as seen in primates with orbital prefrontal cortex lesions.}

      \field{abstract}{Brain structures thought to be critical for learning and memory were lesioned, and the effects on rats' ability to locate food on a radial maze in situations that provided different types of information was used to suggest general principles of information processing by hypothesized neural systems that include each of the lesioned structures. When animals were confined to food-containing and empty arms on different training trials, the learned discrimination between the arms was amygdala based. More training trials were required for ambiguous (adjacent arms) than for unambiguous (widely separated arms) discriminations. When rats moved around and entered both food and no-food arms on the same trial, the unambiguous discrimination was learned by both dorsal striatum- and hippocampus-based systems; however, the ambiguous discrimination was learned only by the hippocampus system.}

      \field{abstract}{Isolated single units in rat dorsal hippocampus and fascia dentata were classified as 'Theta' or 'Complex-Spike' cells, and their firing characteristics were examined with respect to position, direction and velocity of movement during forced choice, food rewarded search behavior on a radial eight arm maze. Most spikes from CS cells occurred when the animal was located within a particular place on the maze and moving in a particular direction. Theta cells had very low spatial selectivity. Both cell categories had discharge probabilities which increased somewhat as a function of running velocity but tended to asymptote well before half-maximal velocity. The place/direction specificity of CS cells was significantly higher in CA1 than in CA3 and CA3 CS cells exhibited a striking preference for the inward radial direction. The pronounced directional selectivity of CS cells, at least in the present environment, suggests that they fire in response to complex, but specific, stimulus features in the extramaze world rather than to absolute place in a non-egocentric space. An alternative possibility is that the geometrical constraints of the maze surface have a profound influence on the shapes of the response fields of CS cells.}

      \field{abstract}{Behavioral and neurophysiological evidence strongly suggests that, within certain limits, rodents and humans can keep track of their directional heading relative to an inertial, and hence allocentric coordinate system. This "sense of direction" appears to involve the integration of angular velocity signals that arise primarily in the vestibular system. A hypothesis is proposed in which the integration process, an operation that may be difficult for neurons to implement, is replaced by a linear associative mapping, an operation that is at least theoretically easy to implement with neurons. The proposed system makes use of a set of linearly independent vectors representing the combination of the current head direction, and head angular velocity representations to "recall" the resulting head direction. It is then proposed that visual landmarks become incorporated into the directional system, enabling both the correction of cumulative error and, ultimately, the computation of novel, optimal trajectories between locations. According to the hypothesis, this occurs through the association of hippo-campal "local-view" cells (i.e., direction selective "place cells") with "head-direction" cells located downstream in the dorsal presubiculum. The possible neurophysiological and neuroan-atomical bases for the proposed system are discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{Theories of sequence learning based on temporally asymmetric, Hebbian long-term potentiation predict that during route learning the spatial firing distributions of hippocampal neurons should enlarge in a direction opposite to the animal's movement. On a route AB, increased synaptic drive from cells representing A would cause cells representing B to fire earlier and more robustly. These effects appeared within a few laps in rats running on closed tracks. This provides indirect evidence for Hebbian synaptic plasticity and a functional explanation for why place cells become directionally selective during route following, namely, to preserve the synaptic asymmetry necessary to encode the sequence direction.}

      \field{abstract}{The hippocampus appears to undergo continual representational reorganization as animals navigate their environments. This reorganization is postulated to be reflected spatially in terms of changes in the ensemble of place cells activated, as well as changes in place field specificity and reliability for cells recorded in both hilar/CA3 and CA1 regions. The specific contribution of the hilar/CA3 region is suggested to be to compare the expected spatial context with that currently being experienced, then relay discrepancies to CA1. The properties of CA1 place fields in part reflect the spatial comparisons made in the hilar/CA3 area. In addition, CA1 organizes the input received from the hilar/CA3 place cells according to different temporal algorithms that are unique to different tasks. In this way, hippocampus helps to distinguish temporally one spatial context from another, thereby contributing to episodic memories.}

      \field{abstract}{Dissociable effects of bilateral excitotoxic lesions of different regions of the rat neocortex, including medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, were investigated in a five-choice serial reaction time task that provides several indices of the accuracy and speed of attentional function. Whereas medial prefrontal cortical lesions impaired performance of the task as revealed by a reduction in choice accuracy, an increase in the latency to respond correctly to the visual target and enhanced perseverative responding, lesions of the anterior cingulate cortex specifically increased premature responding. By contrast, lateral frontal cortical lesions did not significantly disrupt baseline performance of the task, but rather increased the latency to respond correctly to the visual target during various behavioral manipulations, for example, when the length of the intertrial interval was varied unpredictably and during interpolation of distracting bursts of white noise. Lesions of the parietal cortex failed to disrupt any aspect of task performance investigated. These behavioral effects in the five-choice task were compared with the effect of these same lesions on acquisition and retention of a one-trial passive avoidance task. The main finding from this paradigm was that lesions of the lateral frontal cortex produced a significant disruption to the retention of passive avoidance, which stands in marked contrast to the successful retention observed by animals of the other lesion groups. In addition, this pattern of results reveals that the 'disinhibitory' effect of cingulate cortex lesions are relatively specific to the five-choice attentional task. Finally, the results of the present study are compared with the findings of previous experiments using the five-choice task, which have examined the effect of selective manipulations of the ascending noradrenergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic projections. In particular, the deficits in attentional function observed following cholinergic lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis appear to be attributable to cholinergic denervation of the medial frontal cortex. These results are discussed in terms of the role of parallel distributed neural systems within the neocortex that mediate continuous attentional performance in the rat.}

      \field{abstract}{One of the routine memory abilities impaired in amnesic patients with temporal-lobe damage is object-recognition memory--the ability to discriminate the familiarity of previously encountered objects. Reproducing this impairment has played a central role in animal models of amnesia during the past two decades, and until recent years most of the emphasis was on describing how hippocampal damage could impair object recognition. Today most investigators are looking outside the hippocampus to explain the impairment. This paper reviews studies of object-recognition memory in rats with hippocampal damage produced by ablation, fornix transection, or forebrain ischemia. Some new perspectives on previous findings reinforce the conclusion that damage to the hippocampus has little if any impact on the ability to recognize objects, while damage in some areas outside the hippocampus is far more effective. The few circumstances in which hippocampal damage can impair performance on object-recognition tasks are situations where ancillary abilities are likely to play a significant role in supporting task performance. Some of the factors that contributed to the origins and persistence of the hippocampalcentric view of object-recognition are considered, including lesion confounds, failure to distinguish between impaired task performance and impairment of a memory ability, and disproportionate attention to a few lesion studies in monkeys, even though the hypothesis was tested far more times in rats, under a greater variety of conditions, and rejected on nearly every occasion.}

      \field{abstract}{Rhesus monkeys learned 10 visual stimulus-stimulus association, or paired associates. They then received bilateral removals of either the amygdaloid complex and underlying cortex, the hippocampal formation and underlying cortex, or both combined, or they were retained as unoperated controls. After surgery or rest, the monkeys were tested for their retention of the preoperatively learned set of paired associates, as well as for their ability to learn new associations of the same type. Both unoperated controls and hippocampectomized monkeys relearned the preoperatively trained set of paired associates almost immediately. By contrast, monkeys with amygdala removals were moderately retarded in relearning, and monkeys with combined amygdala and hippocampal ablations were severely retarded. When confronted with new sets of visual stimuli, monkeys with amygdala removals or hippocampal removals learned new sets of paired associates at the same rate as the controls, whereas monkeys with the combined ablation were again profoundly retarded. Only one monkey with the combined lesion was able to learn new stimulus-stimulus associations to criterion, and then only after extensive training, despite the ability of all three animals in this group to perform delayed matching-to-sample with the same stimuli and the same intraatrial delays as those used in the paired associate task. At the end of the main experiment, two of the unoperated controls received bilateral ablations of the rhinal cortex. These monkeys showed the same level of difficulty in learning new paired associates as the animals in the main experiment that had received the combined amygdala plus hippocampal ablations. The results implicate the medial temporal lobe, and particularly the rhinal cortex, in the formation of stimulus-stimulus associative memories.}

      \field{abstract}{Pattern completion, the ability to retrieve complete memories on the basis of incomplete sets of cues, is a crucial function of biological memory systems. The extensive recurrent connectivity of the CA3 area of hippocampus has led to suggestions that it might provide this function. We have tested this hypothesis by generating and analyzing a genetically engineered mouse strain in which the N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) receptor gene is ablated specifically in the CA3 pyramidal cells of adult mice. The mutant mice normally acquired and retrieved spatial reference memory in the Morris water maze, but they were impaired in retrieving this memory when presented with a fraction of the original cues. Similarly, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in mutant mice displayed normal place-related activity in a full-cue environment but showed a reduction in activity upon partial cue removal. These results provide direct evidence for CA3 NMDA receptor involvement in associative memory recall.}

      \field{abstract}{By virtue of its frontal and hippocampal connections, the retrosplenial cortex is uniquely placed to support cognition. Here, we tested whether the retrosplenial cortex is required for frontal tasks analogous to the Stroop Test, i.e., for the ability to select between conflicting responses and inhibit responding to task-irrelevant cues. Rats first acquired two instrumental conditional discriminations, one auditory and one visual, set in two distinct contexts. As a result, rats were rewarded for pressing either the right or left lever when a particular auditory or visual signal was present. In extinction, rats received compound stimuli that either comprised the auditory and visual elements that signaled the same lever response (congruent) or signaled different lever responses (incongruent) during training. On conflict (incongruent) trials, lever selection by sham-operated animals followed the stimulus element that had previously been trained in that same test context, whereas animals with retrosplenial cortex lesions failed to disambiguate the conflicting response cues. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that this abnormality on conflict trials was not due to a failure in distinguishing the contexts. Rather, these data reveal the selective involvement of the rat retrosplenial cortex in response conflict, and so extend the frontal system underlying cognitive control.}

      \field{abstract}{Theories of associative memory suggest that successful memory storage and recall depend on a balance between two complementary processes: pattern separation (to minimize interference) and pattern completion (to retrieve a memory when presented with partial or degraded input cues). Putative attractor circuitry in the hippocampal CA3 region is thought to be the final arbiter between these two processes. Here we present direct, quantitative evidence that CA3 produces an output pattern closer to the originally stored representation than its degraded input patterns from the dentate gyrus (DG). We simultaneously recorded activity from CA3 and DG of behaving rats when local and global reference frames were placed in conflict. CA3 showed a coherent population response to the conflict (pattern completion), even though its DG inputs were severely disrupted (pattern separation). The results thus confirm the hallmark predictions of a longstanding computational model of hippocampal memory processing.}

      \field{abstract}{Quick and efficient traversal of learned routes is critical to the survival of many animals. Routes can be defined by both the ordering of navigational epochs, such as continued forward motion or execution of a turn, and the distances separating them. The neural substrates conferring the ability to fluidly traverse complex routes are not well understood, but likely entail interactions between frontal, parietal, and rhinal cortices and the hippocampus. This paper demonstrates that posterior parietal cortical neurons map both individual and multiple navigational epochs with respect to their order in a route. In direct contrast to spatial firing patterns of hippocampal neurons, parietal neurons discharged in a place- and direction-independent fashion. Parietal route maps were scalable and versatile in that they were independent of the size and spatial configuration of navigational epochs. The results provide a framework in which to consider parietal function in spatial cognition.}

      \field{abstract}{It has been proposed that the perirhinal cortex is involved in the representation of the characteristics of objects. In particular it has been proposed that it is critical for discriminating between stimuli which have some features in common and thus it has been described as being involved in resolving feature ambiguity. The present experiments demonstrate that lesions of perirhinal cortex in the rat cause impairments in object recognition which increase with the level of feature ambiguity present in the discrimination. Although increasing feature ambiguity increases the overall difficulty of discriminations, lesions of the perirhinal cortex resulted in a disproportionate impairment when feature ambiguity was increased and not when the difficulty of the discrimination was increased through enlargement of the stimulus set. The present experiments therefore support the view that perirhinal cortex in the rat is critical to resolution of feature ambiguity in stimulus specification.}

      \field{abstract}{Object recognition memory was assessed on a novel-object preference (NOP) task in rats with lesions of the hippocampal formation (HPC). The learning and test phases of NOP trials occurred in either the same context or in different contexts. When the learning and test contexts were the same, rats with HPC lesions performed like control rats, displaying a significant tendency to investigate a novel object more than a familiar sample object. When the test occurred in a context that was familiar but different from the learning context, performance was unaffected in control rats, but rats with HPC lesions no longer discriminated between the objects, and therefore showed no evidence of recognizing the sample object. When the test context was unfamiliar, novel-object preference in control rats was attenuated but still above chance levels, whereas rats with HPC lesions did not show a preference. The data suggest that the HPC is not critical for encoding or retrieving conjunctive representations of the context in which incidental learning occurs, whereas it plays an essential role in recognition of objects that are subsequently encountered in different contexts.}

      \field{abstract}{The authors present a theoretical framework for understanding the roles of the hippocampus and neocortex in learning and memory. This framework incorporates a theme found in many theories of hippocampal function: that the hippocampus is responsible for developing conjunctive representations binding together stimulus elements into a unitary representation that can later be recalled from partial input cues. This idea is contradicted by the fact that hippocampally lesioned rats can learn nonlinear discrimination problems that require conjunctive representations. The authors' framework accommodates this finding by establishing a principled division of labor, where the cortex is responsible for slow learning that integrates over multiple experiences to extract generalities whereas the hippocampus performs rapid learning of the arbitrary contents of individual experiences. This framework suggests that tasks involving rapid, incidental conjunctive learning are better tests of hippocampal function. The authors implement this framework in a computational neural network model and show that it can account for a wide range of data in animal learning.}

      \field{abstract}{Rats with lesions of the entorhinal or parietal cortex were tested in a homing task on a circular platform containing food cups and surrounded by curtains. The animals had to leave a refuge, explore the platform to find a hidden piece of food and carry it back to the refuge. Once the rats were proficient at performing the procedural aspects of the task, they were tested in two successive types of trials in which the food pellet was either always located in the central cup (food at center, "FAC" trials) or placed in a randomly chosen cup (food at random, "FAR" trials). Except in the first FAC trials, all groups displayed similar outward paths in FAC and FAR trials, showing that both types of trials involved equivalent path integration demand. Analysis of the homing accuracy showed that rats with entorhinal cortex or parietal cortex lesions exhibited inaccurate returns to the starting hole, suggesting that these two cortical areas are part of a neural network mediating path integration.}

      \field{abstract}{Recent evidence suggests that rats require an intact hippocampus in order to recognize familiar objects when they encounter them again in a different context. The two experiments reported here further examined how changes in context affect rats' performance on the novel-object preference (NOP) test of object-recognition memory, and how those effects interact with the effects of HPC damage. Rats with HPC lesions and control rats received NOP testing in either the same context in which they had previously encountered sample objects, or in a different but equally familiar context. In Experiment 1, the two contexts had very few overlapping cues within or outside the apparatus; thus, the differences between them were global. Consistent with previous results, control rats showed a novel-object preference in both the unchanged and (globally) changed contexts, whereas rats with HPC lesions displayed a preference only in the unchanged context. In Experiment 2, the context shift included only local features proximal to the test objects. The main results were the reverse of Experiment 1--rats with HPC lesions displayed a novel-object preference in both the unchanged and (locally) changed contexts, whereas control rats displayed a preference only in the unchanged context. The findings are consistent with the view that HPC damage does not cause a general inability to recognize objects, nor an inability to encode or store a representation of the context in which the objects are encountered. They suggest instead that HPC damage impairs the ability to remember specific locations of familiar objects within a particular context.}

      \field{abstract}{The present study revealed striking task-dependent differences in immediate-early gene activity in the two main subregions (granular and dysgranular) of the retrosplenial cortex. In addition, there were activity differences along the rostro-caudal axis of both subregions. Two groups of rats were trained on a working memory task in a radial-arm maze, one group in the light, the other in the dark. Each working memory group had two sets of yoked controls. Working memory consistently increased retrosplenial immediate-early gene activity (c-fos and zif268), although systematic differences occurred in the granular and dysgranular subregions. Both c-fos and zif268 expression increased in granular cortex irrespective of whether the spatial memory task was in the light or dark. In contrast, only in the light did spatial memory increase dysgranular cortex activation. Correlations based on the counts of Fos-positive cells helped to reinforce the particular association between the dysgranular retrosplenial cortex and radial-arm maze performance in the light. These results provide clear evidence for proposed functional differences between the major retrosplenial subregions: the granular cortex contributes to spatial learning and navigation based on both internal and external cues (light and dark), while dysgranular cortex is more selectively involved when distal visual cues control performance (light only).}

      \field{abstract}{It is well established that the dorsal hippocampal formation is crucial for spatial memory in rats. However, little is known about the distinct functions of the dorsal hippocampus and the dorsal subiculum. To examine the role of the dorsal hippocampus and the dorsal subiculum, Long-Evans rats with excitotoxic lesions (NMDA) of the dorsal hippocampus (DH), the dorsal subiculum (DS), or both (DHDS), and controls were trained on a nonmatching-to-place task. Then, to identify the strategy used by each group, they were tested on the same task in the dark with the T-maze being rotated between the sample and the test runs. In the light, rats with combined lesions were impaired. In the dark, groups DH, DS, and controls performed near chance level except in trials without rotation, suggesting the use of a sense of direction. The same rats were trained on a radial-arm maze task. In the light, where proximal visual cues were accessible, combined lesions affected performance whereas in the dark, it was impaired by all lesions. This experiment demonstrated that the dorsal subiculum and the dorsal hippocampus play a crucial role in processing idiothetic information and/or in maintenance of this information in memory.}

      \field{abstract}{The contribution of the dorsal subiculum (DS) and of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) to memory for distinct and overlapping visual stimuli was examined. Rats with selective lesions of the DS or the DH were compared to sham-operated rats on a delayed matching-to-place task guided by distal visual cues in a modified radial-arm maze. Overlapping distal visual cues could be perceived from three arm entrances (adjacent arms) and a unique set of distal cues were more likely to be seen from the other two arm entrances (distinct arms). Rats with DS lesions were impaired on trials with baited adjacent arms, but not on trials with baited distinct arms. Rats with DH lesions were impaired on both types of trials. These results suggest that the DS and the DH are necessary for pattern separation and that they may have different contributions to memory.}

      \field{abstract}{The contribution of the dorsal subiculum (DS) to memory for temporal order and novelty detection was assessed using a spontaneous exploration paradigm with objects (visual/tactile stimuli), odors, or spatial locations (Hunsaker, Fieldsted, Rosenberg, \& Kesner, 2008). Rats with selective excitotoxic lesions of the DS were compared to sham-operated rats (SHAM) in the two exploration tests. In temporal order tests, two previously explored stimuli were presented and normal rats typically show a preference for exploring the stimulus that was first explored compared to the other stimulus. In novelty detection tests, a familiar and a new stimulus were presented and normal rats typically have a preference for exploring new stimuli. In temporal order tests, results indicated that Group SHAM explored significantly more the first than the last stimulus they met when the stimuli were odors or objects. In addition, SHAM rats predictably displayed a significant preference for the new stimulus in the novelty detection tests with objects, odors, and spatial locations. Group DS did not differ from controls on the temporal order and the novelty detection tests with objects or odors. However, on the novelty detection test with spatial locations, Group DS differed from Group SHAM. These results suggest that the DS is necessary for the memory of spatial locations but not of objects and odors.}

      \field{abstract}{Normal rats and rats sustaining septal or medial frontal cortex lesions were compared in experiments dealing with object exploration, habituation, and reaction to novelty (measured by renewed exploration following a spatial change). Normal rats exhibited high levels of initial exploratory activity which decreased over time. Following a spatial change, they reinvestigated both the displaced object and the nondisplaced ones. Frontal animals were similar to normal subjects with respect to their initial exploratory level and habituation pattern. However, frontal rats reexplored only the displaced object and completely neglected the nondisplaced ones. In contrast, the behavioral pattern displayed by septal rats was markedly different from that of normal and frontal animals. Septal rats had lower levels of initial exploratory activity, did not habituate over time, and failed to react to either displaced or nondisplaced objects. These results show that although the septo-hippocampal complex and the medial frontal cortex may share some common function in spatially organized behaviors, both structures have unique roles. Some hypotheses about the possible basic processes subtended by the septal area or the medial frontal cortex are briefly mentioned and discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{This article provides a hierarchical model of animal spatial cognitive maps. Such maps include both topological information, which affords loose, yet operational, representations of the connectivity of space and its overall arrangement, and metric information, which provides information about angles and distances. The model holds that maps can be initially described as a set of location-dependent reference frameworks providing directional information about other locations. The addition of an overall directional reference allows for the buildup of more complete (allocentric) representations. A survey of recent neurobiological data provides some hints about the brain structures involved in these processes and suggests that the hippocampal formation and the posterior parietal cortex would act differently by handling topological and metric information, respectively.}

      \field{abstract}{Hippocampal "place cells" fire when a freely moving rat is in a given location. The firing of these cells is controlled by visual and nonvisual environmental cues. The effects of darkness on the firing of place cells was studied using the task of Muller et al. (1987), in which rats were trained to chase randomly scattered food pellets in a cylindrical drum with a white cue-card attached to the wall. The position of the rats was tracked via an infrared LED on the headstage with a video system linked to computer. Two experimental protocols were used: in the first, lights were turned off after the rat had already been placed in the chamber; in the second, the rat was placed in the darkened chamber. The dark segments produced by these 2 methods were identical with respect to light and other cues but differed with respect to the rat's experience. The firing patterns of 24 of 28 cells were unaffected by darkness when it was preceded by a light period. In contrast, the firing patterns of 14 of 22 cells changed dramatically when the rats were put into the darkened chamber. Furthermore, the majority of cells that changed their firing pattern in initial darkness maintained that change when the lights were turned on. These results show that place cells can fire differently in identical cue situations and that the best predictor of firing pattern is a combination of current cues and the rat's recent experience. The results are discussed in terms of mnemonic properties of hippocampal cells and "remapping" of place cell representations.}

      \field{abstract}{The present experiments investigated the role of the prelimbic-infralimbic areas in behavioral flexibility using a place-response learning paradigm. All rats received a bilateral cannula implant aimed at the prelimbic-infralimbic areas. To examine the role of the prelimbic-infralimbic areas in shifting strategies, rats were tested on a place and a response discrimination in a cross-maze. Some rats were tested on the place version first followed by the response version. The procedure for the other rats was reversed. Infusions of 2\% tetracaine into the prelimbic-infralimbic areas did not impair acquisition of the place or response discriminations. Prelimbic-infralimbic inactivation did impair learning when rats were switched from one discrimination to the other (cross-modal shift). To investigate the role of the prelimbic-infralimbic areas in intramodal shifts (reversal learning), one group of rats was tested on a place reversal and another group tested on a response reversal. Prelimbic-infralimbic inactivation did not impair place or response intramodal shifts. Some rats that completed testing on a particular version in the cross-modal and intramodal experiments were tested on the same version in a new room for 3 d. The transfer tests revealed that rats use a spatial strategy on the place version and an egocentric response strategy on the response version. Overall, these results suggest that the prelimbic-infralimbic areas are important for behavioral flexibility involving cross-modal but not intramodal shifts.}

      \field{abstract}{The present experiment examined the effects of quinolinic acid (125 mM) lesions of the agranular insular area on working memory for food reward value and working memory for spatial locations. In both tasks a go/no-go procedure was used. Working memory for food reward value was assessed using a delayed conditional discrimination in which either a 20\% or 45\% sugar content cereal was associated with a reinforcement and the other cereal was not. In the spatial locations task, rats were allowed to enter 12 arms in a radial maze for a food reinforcement. Of the 12 arm presentations, three or four arms were presented for a second time in a session which did not contain a reinforcement. The number of trials between the 1st and 2nd presentation of an arm ranged from 0 to 6 (lags). Working memory was assessed by the latency to enter an arm during the 2nd presentation. In the food reward value task, agranular insular lesions produced memory deficits in a delay-dependent manner. In contrast, agranular insular lesions did not impair working memory for spatial locations. These results add to accumulating evidence suggesting that different types of working memory are distributed across separate prefrontal subregions.}

      \field{abstract}{Anatomical and functional findings support the contention that there is a distinct posterior parietal cortical area (PPC) in the rat, situated between the rostrally adjacent hindlimb sensorimotor area and the caudally adjacent secondary visual areas. The PPC is distinguished from these areas by receiving thalamic afferents from the lateral dorsal (LD), lateral posterior (LP), and posterior (Po) nuclei, in the absence of input from the ventrobasal complex (VB) or dorsal lateral geniculate (DLG) nuclei. Behavioral studies have demonstrated that PPC is involved in spatial orientation and directed attention. In the present study we used fluorescent retrograde axonal tracers primarily to investigate the cortical connections of PPC, in order to determine the organization of the circuitry by which PPC is likely to participate in these functions, and also to determine how the topography of its thalamic connections differs from that of neighboring cortical areas. The cortical connections of PPC involve the ventrolateral (VLO) and medial (MO) orbital areas, medial agranular cortex (area Fr2), portions of somatic sensory areas Par1 and Par2, secondary visual areas Oc2M and Oc2L, auditory area Te1, and retrosplenial cortex. The secondary visual areas Oc2L and Oc2M have cortical connections which are similar to those of PPC, but are restricted within orbital cortex to area VLO, and within area Fr2 to its caudal portion, and do not involve auditory area Te1. The cortical connections of hindlimb cortex are largely restricted to somatic sensory and motor areas. Retrosplenial cortex, which is medially adjacent to PPC, has cortical connections that are prominent with visual cortex, do not involve somatic sensory or auditory cortex, and include the presubiculum. We conclude that PPC is distinguished by its pattern of cortical connections with the somatic sensory, auditory and visual areas, and with areas Fr2, and VLO/MO, in addition to its exclusive thalamic connectivity with LD, LP and Po. Because recent behavioral studies indicate that PPC, Fr2 and VLO are involved in directed attention and spatial learning, we suggest that the interconnections among these three cortical areas represent a major component of the circuitry for these functions in rats.}

      \field{abstract}{The goal of the present experiments was to use a disconnection paradigm to test the interactions between the hippocampus and parietal cortex (PC) during an object-place paired associate learning task, dry-land water maze task, and a reaction-to-change task. Previous research indicates that these tasks are sensitive to hippocampal or PC disruption. Unilateral lesions were made to the dorsal hippocampus or posterior PC in contralateral hemispheres or ipsilateral hemispheres. It was hypothesized that if the hippocampus and PC interact, then contralateral lesioned animals should be markedly impaired compared to ipsilateral lesions. The results indicate that contralateral lesioned animals were significantly more impaired than animals with ipsilateral lesions during object-place paired-associate learning; however, both groups readily learned single discriminations (i.e., objects or places). Furthermore, contralateral lesioned animals traveled further to find the reward during acquisition of the dry-land water maze task and spent less time in the rewarded quadrant during the probe trial. Conversely, contralateral lesioned animals' performance matched ipsilateral lesioned animals during the reaction-to-change paradigm. Thus, the hippocampus and PC interact during some tasks, presumably when tasks require multiple trials across days, but not during the detection of novelty within a single day.}

      \field{abstract}{First, what is computed by the hippocampus is considered. Based on the effects of damage to the hippocampus and neuronal activity recorded in the primate hippocampus, it is suggested that it is involved in associating together information usually originating from different cortical regions, for example, about objects and their place in a spatial environment. The rapid formation of such context-dependent memories is prototypical of memories of particular events or episodes. Second, a computational theory of how it performs this function, based on neuroanatomical and neurophysiological information about the different neuronal systems contained within the hippocampus, is described. Key hypotheses are that the CA3 pyramidal cells operate as a single autoassociation network to store new episodic information as it arrives via a number of specialized preprocessing stages from many different association areas of the cerebral cortex, and that the dentate granule cell/mossy fiber system is important particularly during learning to help to produce a new pattern of firing in the CA3 cells for each episode. The computational analysis shows how many memories could be stored in the hippocampus, and how quickly the CA3 autoassociation system would operate during recall. The analysis is then extended to show how the CA3 system could be used to recall the whole of an episodic memory when only a fragment of it is presented. It is shown how this retrieval within the hippocampus could lead to recall of neuronal activity in association areas of the cerebral neocortex similar to that present during the original episode, via modified synapses in backprojection pathways from the hippocampus to the cerebral neocortex. The recalled information in the cerebral neocortex could then by used by the neocortex in the formation of long-term memories and/or in the selection of appropriate actions.}

      \field{abstract}{The main aim of the paper is to present an up-to-date computational theory of hippocampal function and the predictions it makes about the different subregions (dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1), and to examine behavioral and electrophysiological data that address the functions of the hippocampus and particularly its subregions. Based on the computational proposal that the dentate gyrus produces sparse representations by competitive learning and via the mossy fiber pathway forces new representations on the CA3 during learning (encoding), it has been shown behaviorally that the dentate gyrus supports spatial pattern separation during learning. Based on the computational proposal that CA3-CA3 autoassociative networks are important for episodic memory, it has been shown behaviorally that the CA3 supports spatial rapid one-trial learning, learning of arbitrary associations where space is a component, pattern completion, spatial short-term memory, and sequence learning by associations formed between successive items. The concept that the CA1 recodes information from CA3 and sets up associatively learned backprojections to neocortex to allow subsequent retrieval of information to neocortex, is consistent with findings on consolidation. Behaviorally, the CA1 is implicated in processing temporal information as shown by investigations requiring temporal order pattern separation and associations across time; computationally this could involve temporal decay memory, and temporal sequence memory which might also require CA3. The perforant path input to DG is implicated in learning, to CA3 in retrieval from CA3, and to CA1 in retrieval after longer time intervals ("intermediate-term memory").}

      \field{abstract}{The enormous potential of modern molecular neuroanatomical tools lies in their ability to determine the precise connectivity of the neuronal cell types comprising the innate circuitry of the brain. We used transgenically targeted viral tracing to identify the monosynaptic inputs to the projection neurons of layer II of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC-LII) in mice. These neurons are not only major inputs to the hippocampus, the structure most clearly implicated in learning and memory, they also are "grid cells." Here we address the question of what kinds of inputs are specifically targeting these MEC-LII cells. Cell-specific infection of MEC-LII with recombinant rabies virus results in unambiguous labeling of monosynaptic inputs. Furthermore, ratios of labeled neurons in different regions are largely consistent between animals, suggesting that label reflects density of innervation. While the results mostly confirm prior anatomical work, they also reveal a novel major direct input to MEC-LII from hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, the vast majority of these direct hippocampal inputs arise not from the major hippocampal subfields of CA1 and CA3, but from area CA2, a region that has historically been thought to merely be a transitional zone between CA3 and CA1. We confirmed this unexpected result using conventional tracing techniques in both rats and mice.}

The authors tested the effects of dorsal hippocampal and parietal lesions in a homing task to dissociate the respective roles of the hippocampus and the parietal cortex in path integration. Hippocampal rats exhibited a strong deficit in learning the basic task. Parietal rats displayed a performance impairment as a function of the complexity of their outward paths when the food was placed at varying locations. These results suggest that the parietal cortex plays a specific role in path integration and in the processing of idiothetic information, whereas the hippocampus is involved in the calibration of space used by the path integration system.}

      \field{abstract}{The hippocampus and associative parietal cortex (APC) both contribute to spatial memory but the nature of their functional interaction remains unknown. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of APC lesions on hippocampal place cell firing in freely moving rats. Place cells were recorded from APC-lesioned and control rats as they performed a pellet-chasing task in a circular arena containing three object cues. During successive recording sessions, cue manipulations including object rotation in the absence of the rat and object removal in the presence of the rat were made to examine the control exerted by the objects or by non-visual intramaze cues on place field location, respectively. Object rotations resulted in equivalent field rotation for all cells in control rats. In contrast, a fraction of place fields in APC-lesioned rats did not rotate but remained stable relative to the room. Object removal produced different effects in APC-lesioned and control rats. In control rats, most place fields remained stable relative to the previous object rotation session, indicating that they were anchored to olfactory and/or idiothetic cues. In APC-lesioned rats, a majority of place fields shifted back to their initial, standard location, thus suggesting that they relied on uncontrolled background cues to maintain place field stability. These results provide strong evidence that the hippocampus and the APC cooperate in the formation of spatial memory and suggest that the APC is involved in elaboration of a hippocampal map based on proximal landmarks.}

      \field{abstract}{Growing evidence suggests that the associative parietal cortex (APC) of the rat is involved in the processing of spatial information. This observation raises the issue of the respective functions of the APC and the hippocampus in spatial processing as well as of their possible interactions. In this paper, we review neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral data that support the existence of such functional interactions. Our hypothesis is that the APC is involved in the initial combination of visuospatial information and self-motion information necessary for the integration of egocentrically acquired information into allocentrically coded information, the latter step being completed in the hippocampus. The dialogue between the hippocampus and the APC is therefore crucial, particularly when the elaboration and/or updating of an allocentric representation depends on complex combinations of visuospatial and self-motion information.}

      \field{abstract}{Rats with dorsal hippocampus or associative parietal cortex (APC) lesions and sham-operated controls were trained on variants of the Morris water maze navigation task. In the 'proximal landmark condition', the rats had to localize the hidden platform solely on the basis of three salient object landmarks placed directly in the swimming pool. In the 'distal landmark condition', rats could rely only on distal landmarks (room cues) to locate the platform. In the 'beacon condition', the platform location was signaled by a salient cue directly attached to it. Rats with hippocampal lesions were impaired in the distal and to a less extent in the proximal landmark condition whereas rats with parietal lesions were impaired only in the proximal landmark condition. None of the lesioned groups was impaired in the beacon condition. These results suggest that the processing of information related to proximal, distal landmarks or associated beacon are mediated by different neural systems. The hippocampus would contribute to both proximal and distal landmark processing whereas the APC would be involved in the processing of proximal landmarks only. Navigation relying on a cued-platform would not require participation of the hippocampus nor the APC. Assuming that the processing of proximal landmarks heavily depends on the integration of visuospatial and idiothetic information, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the APC plays a role in the combination of multiple sensory information and contributes to the formation of an allocentric spatial representation.}

First, all groups displayed habituation of both locomotor and exploratory activity. Second, controls selectively reexplored displaced objects, and APC-lesioned rats reexplored all objects, whereas PPC- and HIP-lesioned rats failed to react to the spatial change. Third, a novel object induced reexploration in all groups. The results are consistent with the roles of the HIP and PPC in spatial information processing. Moreover, the APC and PPC are involved in attentional effortful processing and visuospatial information processing necessary for spatial representation, respectively.}

      \field{abstract}{The effects of reversible lidocaine-induced lesions of 2 subregions of the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were examined on a series of cognitively based foraging behaviors on a radial-arm maze. Lesions of the prelimbic (PL) or anterior cingulate (AC) cortex prior to the retention phase of a delayed-foraging task disrupted performance differentially; rats with PL lesions visited arms in a random manner, whereas rats with AC lesions revisited previously baited arms preferentially. Rats with AC lesions were also impaired on a single-trial foraging task; they made numerous revisits to previously baited arms. PL lesions had no effect on performance of this task in well-trained rats. However, rats trained on the 2-phase task did not adapt to a new foraging strategy after a PL lesions, when they were switched unexpectedly to the single-trial foraging task. These data demonstrate functional heterogeneity within the rat mPFC and suggest that the PL is involved in processes through which recently acquired information is used to organize and modify foraging behavior, whereas the AC may play an important role in response flexibility.}

      \field{abstract}{Cells in several portions of the hippocampal formation show location-related firing, so that the momentary rate of each cell signals the spatial location of a freely moving rat. Insight into how these signals are generated, and how they travel around the hippocampal circuitry, can be gained by examination of the exact timing of the locational signal. Here, this was investigated for both hippocampal and subicular cells. For this, several aspects of the spatial firing pattern of each cell were examined over a series of time shifts, in which spikes were paired with locations occupied by the animal in either the immediate past, present, or future. Results showed that subicular cells appear to anticipate future locations by approximately 50 to 70 msec, on average. In contrast, hippocampal cells were best correlated with positions about 30 to 40 msec in the future. However, this timing, for hippocampal cells only, was related to the average session running speed, so that the cells were correlated with future locations at slow speeds, but lagged behind (were correlated with past locations) at high speeds. These data support the idea that both subicular and hippocampal cells use a path integration mechanism to generate their spatial signal (since both can anticipate future location). For the hippocampal cells the mechanism does not, apparently, take into account speed information, however. Also, the data suggest that the subicular signal cannot be the result of simple transmission of spatial information from the hippocampus to the subiculum, since this would predict that the subicular signal should correlate with later positions than the hippocampal signal.}

      \field{abstract}{At least two important questions are posed by the existence of hippocampal place cells. The first of these has to do with how the complex, abstract properties exhibited by these cells can be explained mechanistically. The second has to do with the implications of place cells for our conception of the broader role of the hippocampus in spatial and other behaviors. Here, evidence is reviewed that: (1) Hippocampal cells show different "maps" (place cell representations) for each environment the animal visits and, in fact, can show multiple maps even for any one environment. The choice of the current map for any one environment depends on environmental, contextual, and event-related variables. (2) Cells in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex also show location-specific firing patterns (like hippocampal place cells), but show the same pattern for each environment the animal visits. A model is presented that is a variant of hippocampus-based path integration models developed by McNaughton and colleagues. In this version, the subiculum and entorhinal cortex work together to form a single, universal map that is used for each environment, and that can exhibit path integration abilities. The universal subicular/entorhinal representation is postulated to assist the hippocampal layer to rapidly form new environment and context specific "maps" for each new environment/temporal context ("episode") the animal experiences. In this view, hippocampal layer activity is always obligatorily spatial, due to the input from the entorhinal universal "map." However, the fact that the hippocampus generates a new map in response to global, non-spatial, contextual attributes of each situation, means that the hippocampus is always coding non-spatial aspects of a situation using its obligatorily spatial code. This brings the hippocampal place cell activity in to line with the broader role that has been postulated for the hippocampus in learning and memory functions.}

      \field{abstract}{Cells in the hippocampus and subiculum signal spatial location in fundamentally different ways. Specifically, hippocampal cells show environment-specific spatial patterns, whereas subicular cells show the same pattern in each environment. In this study, cell firing patterns were recorded in both a large square and in a smaller square located within the large square. For some groups, portions of the small square were left in place during exposure to the large square, thus forming partial barriers. Subicular cell patterns during exposure to the large square were expanded versions of those in the small square. Hippocampal cells were likely to change their pattern completely ("remap") during exposure. However, when the barriers were left in place, cells in both areas retained the same pattern while rats were in the small square, regardless of whether they also had access to the entire large square area. Thus, subicular cells can change the size of their spatial pattern to fit the environment but will not do so across barriers.}

      \field{abstract}{Since the initial discovery of place cells in the hippocampus proper, similar spatial firing has been observed in additional regions throughout the hippocampal formation. One such region is the subiculum. Here, most cells show a significant, consistent variation in rate relative to location. Thus, subicular and hippocampal cells are similar, in providing a representation of momentary location in space. However, there are also some fundamental differences. First, many subicular cells have a directional signal superimposed on the place-related patterns. In contrast, hippocampal cells in the open field paradigm used here typically do not show a genuine directional component. The second critical difference has to do with how the cells code different environments. As is well known, hippocampal cells show different spatial patterns in environments which offer distinctly different stimulus properties. For example, a hippocampal cell which fires in the northwest portion of a striped cylinder will likely display a different field, or no field, when recorded in a gray square. In contrast, subicular cells are likely to show the same behavior across environments, such as choosing the northwest region of both enclosures. Further, if two environments differ in size, the subicular patterns will expand/shrink to fit. Thus, it appears that subicular cells form a rigid framework of interrelated firing fields which is fit into each new enclosure. In contrast, hippocampal cells create a new "map" specific to each environment. This suggests that the hippocampal and subicular regions work together to help provide the overall cognitive mapping abilities of the animal.}

      \field{abstract}{Although the functional role of the mammillary bodies has remained obscure, lesion studies suggest this structure may play a role in memory-in particular, memory for spatial information. Indeed, anatomically, the mammillary bodies are strongly interconnected with limbic system regions, such as the hipppocampal formation, which are also thought to play a role in spatial behavior. Each of these limbic regions so far investigated contains cells that signal either the momentary location and/or directional heading of an animal as it travels through space. In fact, the lateral mammillary nucleus itself contains head direction cells, and is thought to be critical for the initial calculation of this directional signal. Here, we provide an initial report on cell activity in the medial mammillary nucleus. Cells were recorded while rats performed a pellet-chasing task that has been used for much of the work on place and head direction cells. The main findings are 1) approximately 1/3 of the cells showed a temporally precise relationship to angular motion of the head, so that they differentially indicated clockwise versus counterclockwise angular motion, 2) approximately 60\% of the cells showed a temporally coarse correlation with translational motion, 3) firing rate for almost all cells was strongly modulated at theta frequency, and 4) no cells showed evidence of either directional or place-related activity. These data suggest that the medial and lateral mammillary nuclei together provide the directional and trajectory information thought to be critical for generation of the spatial signals in the hippocampal region.}

The orientation-specific edge-apposing activity of these "border cells" is maintained when the environment is stretched and during testing in enclosures of different size and shape in different rooms. Border cells are relatively sparse, making up less than 10\% of the local cell population, but can be found in all layers of the medial entorhinal cortex as well as the adjacent parasubiculum, often intermingled with head-direction cells and grid cells. Border cells may be instrumental in planning trajectories and anchoring grid fields and place fields to a geometric reference frame.}

      \field{abstract}{The authors examined set-shifting abilities in rats injected with antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (MK801) or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (LY293558) into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Set-shifting was assessed with a maze-based task requiring a switch between brightness and texture discrimination strategies. Intra-mPFC injection of MK801 prior to training on the 2nd discrimination impaired discrimination strategy acquisition. The MK801-induced deficit was due to increased perseverative responding. AMPA receptor blockade also impaired acquisition of the 2nd discrimination; these impairments were due to more general cognitive deficits. Results suggest that, within the mPFC, both AMPA and NMDA receptors are necessary for set-shifting, and that NMDA receptor hypofunction impairs the capacity to modify existing knowledge or to inhibit responses that are no longer appropriate.}

      \field{abstract}{Substantial information is available concerning the influence of global hippocampal lesions on spatial learning and memory, however the contributions of discrete subregions within the hippocampus to these functions is less well understood. The present investigation utilized kainic acid to bilaterally lesion specific areas of the rat hippocampus. These animals were subsequently tested on a spatial orientation task using a circular water maze, and on an associative/contextual task using passive avoidance conditioning. The results indicate that both the dorsal CA1 and the ventral CA3 subregions play important roles in learning. Specifically, CA1 lesions produced a deficit in the acquisition of the water maze task and a significant memory impairment on the passive avoidance task. CA3 lesions also caused learning deficits in the acquisition of the water maze task, and produced even greater impairments in performance on the passive avoidance task. We conclude that CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subregions each play significant roles in the overall integration of information concerning spatial and associative learning.}

      \field{abstract}{Rats with lesions of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus were trained postoperatively on two spatial conditional associative learning tasks. In the first task, the rats were required to choose one or the other of two objects depending on the location in which they were found. In the second task, the animals learned to turn left or right depending on which one of two visual cues was presented. A third experiment examined the effects of damage to the anterior thalamic nuclei on the eight-arm radial maze, a spatial working memory task. Damage of the anterior thalamic nuclei impaired performance on the radial maze task and the conditional task requiring associations between objects and their location. By contrast, rats with anterior thalamic lesions were able to acquire, at a rate comparable with that of operated control animals, the conditional task requiring associations between objects and body turns. These findings suggest that lesions to the anterior thalamic nuclei result in a general impairment in learning about allocentric spatial information without disrupting the learning of egocentric spatial information.}

      \field{abstract}{Previous studies have identified a population of neurons in the postsubiculum that discharge as a function of the rat's head direction in the horizontal plane (Taube, Muller, \& Ranck, 1990a). To assess the contribution of these cells in spatial learning, Long-Evans rats were tested in a variety of spatial and nonspatial tasks following bilateral electrolytic or neurotoxic lesions of the postsubiculum. Compared to unlesioned control animals, lesioned animals were impaired on two spatial tasks, a radial eight-arm maze task and a Morris water task, although the performance scores of both lesion groups improved over the course of behavioral testing. In contrast, lesioned animals were unimpaired on two nonspatial tasks, a cued version of the water maze task and a conditioned taste-aversion paradigm. In addition, lesioned animals showed transient hyperactivity in an open-field activity test. These results support the concept that neurons in the postsubiculum are part of a neural network involved in the processing of spatial information.}

      \field{abstract}{It is known that the entorhinal cortex plays a crucial role in spatial cognition in rodents. Neuroanatomical and electrophysiological data suggest that there is a functional distinction between 2 subregions within the entorhinal cortex, the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). Rats with MEC or LEC lesions were trained in 2 navigation tasks requiring allothetic (water maze task) or idiothetic (path integration) information processing and 2-object exploration tasks allowing testing of spatial and nonspatial processing of intramaze objects. MEC lesions mildly affected place navigation in the water maze and produced a path integration deficit. They also altered the processing of spatial information in both exploration tasks while sparing the processing of nonspatial information. LEC lesions did not affect navigation abilities in both the water maze and the path integration tasks. They altered spatial and nonspatial processing in the object exploration task but not in the one-trial recognition task. Overall, these results indicate that the MEC is important for spatial processing and path integration. The LEC has some influence on both spatial and nonspatial processes, suggesting that the 2 kinds of information interact at the level of the EC.}

      \field{abstract}{The present study describes the differences and similarities between the connections of the presubiculum and parasubiculum based on retrograde and anterograde tracing experiments. The results demonstrate that both areas have several similar afferent connections, particularly those from subcortical areas such as the claustrum, diagonal band of Broca, anterior thalamus, nucleus reuniens, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei. Both subicular areas also are innervated by axons originating in the ipsilateral and contralateral entorhinal cortex, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. In contrast to these similarities, most axons innervating the presubiculum originate in the lateral dorsal thalamic nucleus, the claustrum, and the contralateral presubiculum. Conversely, the parasubiculum is innervated primarily by axons that originate in area CA1 of the hippocampus, the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, and the contralateral presubiculum and parasubiculum. The major efferent projection from the presubiculum and parasubiculum courses bilaterally to the medial entorhinal cortex; however, the results of the present study confirm previous suggestions that presubicular axons terminate almost exclusively in layers I and III, whereas parasubicular axons innervate layer II. The presubiculum also projects to the anteroventral and laterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, and the lateral ventral portion of the medial mammillary nucleus, whereas the parasubiculum projects prominently to the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, the contralateral presubiculum and parasubiculum, and the lateral dorsal segment of the medial mammillary nucleus. Thus despite some similarities, the major connections of presubiculum and parasubiculum are distinct from one another and distinct from the projections of the adjacent subiculum and postsubiculum. These results suggest that the subicular cortex is considerably more complex than previously envisioned and indicate that each segment may subserve a distinct role in the processing of information by the hippocampal formation.}

      \field{abstract}{In this article 8 male Wistar rats received bilateral lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex, whereas another 8 rats were control operated. Three weeks after surgery, they were exposed to an autoshaping procedure in which the insertion of a lever into the experimental chamber (conditioned stimulus) always preceded the delivery of a response-independent food pellet (unconditioned stimulus). Subjects with lesions acquired this conditional association faster than control-operated subjects as evidenced by the fact that they were more likely than control-operated subjects to contact the conditioned stimulus at higher rates. Locomotor activity, observed in a standard open-field preceding autoshaping sessions, decreased for both groups of subjects with repeated exposure to the open-field, whereas differences between groups were not observed. The same subjects were also exposed to an operant delayed spatial response alternation procedure in which they were required to alternate responding between two levers that were inserted into the experimental chamber after delay intervals of either 5, 10, or 20 s had elapsed. Alternation response accuracy of both subjects with lesions and control subjects decreased as a function of the duration of the delay interval, but control-operated subjects responded more accurately than did lesion subjects at each interval duration. Response accuracy increased with prolonged training for both groups of subjects, but faster for control-operated than for subjects with lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

      \field{abstract}{Despite the connections of the retrosplenial cortex strongly suggesting a role in spatial memory, the lesion data to date have been equivocal. Whether subjects are impaired after retrosplenial lesions seems to depend on whether the lesions were aspirative or excitotoxic, with the latter failing to produce an impairment. A shortcoming of previous excitotoxic lesion studies is that they spared the most caudal part of the retrosplenial cortex. The present study thus used rats with extensive neurotoxic lesions of the retrosplenial cortex that encompassed the entire rostrocaudal extent of this region. These rats were consistently impaired on several tests that tax allocentric memory. In contrast, they were unimpaired on an egocentric discrimination task. Although the lesions did not appear to affect object recognition, clear deficits were found for an object-in-place discrimination. The present study not only demonstrates a role for the retrosplenial cortex in allocentric spatial memory, but also explains why previous excitotoxic lesions have failed to detect any deficits.}

      \field{abstract}{The past decade has seen a transformation in research on the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). This cortical area has emerged as a key member of a core network of brain regions that underpins a range of cognitive functions, including episodic memory, navigation, imagination and planning for the future. It is now also evident that the RSC is consistently compromised in the most common neurological disorders that impair memory. Here we review advances on multiple fronts, most notably in neuroanatomy, animal studies and neuroimaging, that have highlighted the importance of the RSC for cognition, and consider why specifying its precise functions remains problematic.}

      \field{abstract}{Although there is evidence to suggest that the retrosplenial cortex is involved in spatial learning and memory, many lesion studies have left the more caudal part of this region intact so leaving its role untested. In the first experiment, rats with neurotoxic lesions of the caudal half of the retrosplenial cortex (RspC1) were tested on a reference memory task in the water-maze. The RspC1 animals were impaired on initial acquisition although they performed normally on a subsequent probe test. The second experiment looked at working memory in the radial-arm maze and water-maze. Animals with caudal retrosplenial lesions (RspC2) were unimpaired on the acquisition stage of the radial-arm maze task but were impaired when the task involved maze rotation to control for the possible use of intramaze cues. The RspC2 animals also took longer to learn the platform position on a delayed matching-to-place task in the water-maze. These results show a subtle impairment in spatial memory performance that is not as severe as that seen when more complete lesions of the retrosplenial cortex are made.}

      \field{abstract}{Investigations of the neurobiology of memory using experimental animals have modeled many of the characteristic features of amnesia seen in human clinical populations. To examine long-term memory, however, animal models of amnesia often employ extended measures of acquisition, which stand in contrast to the retention measures used with humans. To determine the role of entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry on both information acquisition and long-term retention, rats with bilateral transections of the angular bundle were trained on three object discrimination problems and then retrained two weeks later to measure retention. Animals with discrete lesions of the angular bundle, which disrupted perforant path connections from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and efferent hippocampal-cortical projections, acquired the object discrimination problems normally but showed a marked deficit in retention. These findings are important because they indicate that the role of entorhinal-hippocampal connections may be limited to maintaining some types of information (e.g., single object discriminations) for retention. This dissociation, moreover, suggests that behavioral paradigms that include a measure of retention may be particularly important for characterizing the mnemonic functions of the hippocampal/parahippocampal region.}

      \field{abstract}{Three experiments were designed to evaluate the relative merits of two theories of hippocampal function, the cognitive mapping theory and the working memory theory. Rats were tested in a series of maze tasks that varied in memory requirements. In the experiments that required cognitive mapping but not working memory (Experiments 1 and 3), rats with fimbria-fornix lesions reached stable levels of performance that were as accurate as those of control rats, and they also performed accurately during transfer tests, results demonstrating that they used a cognitive mapping strategy to solve the discrimination. In the experiment that required working memory (Experiment 2), rats with fimbria-fornix lesions performed at chance levels during all of postoperative testing, and they distributed their choices randomly between the correct and the incorrect goals. These results are seen as generally refuting the predictions made by the cognitive mapping theory and supporting the predictions made by the working memory theory. Additional analyses (Experiment 3) examined the nature of a transitory impairment exhibited by rats with fimbria-fornix lesions in two tasks that did not require working memory. Postoperatively, the performance of the rats with lesions was initially impaired but recovered to normal levels with a time course similar to that seen during preoperative acquisition. These results are seen as requiring an extension of the working memory theory of hippocampal function, and discussion is focused on the possibility of a temporary retrograde amnesia following fimbria-fornix lesions and the distinctions between different types of memory abilities.}

      \field{abstract}{A disconnection procedure was used to test whether the hippocampus and anterior thalamic nuclei form functional components of the same spatial memory system. Unilateral excitotoxic lesions were placed in the anterior thalamic (AT) nuclei and hippocampus (HPC) in either the same (AT-HPC Ipsi group) or contralateral (AT-HPC Contra group) hemispheres of rats. The behavioral effects of these combined lesions were compared in several spatial memory tasks sensitive to bilateral hippocampal lesions. In all of the tasks tested, T-maze alternation, radial arm maze, and Morris water maze, those animals with lesions placed in the contralateral hemispheres were more impaired than those animals with lesions in the same hemisphere. These results provide direct support for the notion that the performance of tasks that require spatial memory rely on the operation of the anterior thalamus and hippocampus within an integrated neural network.}

      \field{abstract}{A disconnection procedure was used to test whether projections from the hippocampus to the anterior thalamic nuclei (AT), via the fimbria-fornix (FX), form functional components of a spatial memory system. The behavioural effects of combined unilateral lesions in the AT and FX were compared when they were either in contralateral hemispheres (AT-FX Contra) or the same hemisphere (AT-FX Ipsi). Other groups received bilateral FX lesions and Sham surgeries. Expt 1 demonstrated that none of these lesions affected performance of an object recognition task, while performance of an object location task, which tests the subjects' preference for an object that has changed location, was impaired in the AT-FX Contra and FX groups. In a T-maze alternation task, however, the FX group was severely impaired while both the AT-FX Ipsi and AT-FX Contra lesion groups showed only a mild impairment. In order to test whether spared crossed projections might support spatial performance in the AT-FX Contra group we then examined the effects of a combined AT-FX Contra lesion coupled with transection of the hippocampal commissure. This combination of lesions produced a severe disruption in spatial memory performance in the water maze, radial arm maze and T-maze, which was significantly greater than that produced by ipsilateral and contralateral AT-FX lesions alone. These results support the notion that disconnection of the AT from their hippocampal inputs produces impairments on a range of spatial memory tasks, but indicate that there are an array of different routes that can subserve this function.}

      \field{abstract}{Although there is a good deal of evidence that animals require the hippocampus for learning place responses, animals with damage to the afferent and efferent fibers coursing through the fimbria-fornix have been shown to acquire a place response. This finding suggests either that the cells of the hippocampus proper (CA1-4 and dentate gyrus), via their connections to the temporal lobe, can mediate place learning or that some extrahippocampal structure is sufficient. We examined this question using rats with ibotenic acid lesions of the cells of the hippocampus. Rats were pretrained to swim to a visible platform and then given probe trials on which the visible platform was removed. Video and kinematic analyses showed that the hippocampal rats expected to find the platform at its previous location because they swam directly to that location and paused and turned at that location after the platform was removed. Additional tests confirmed that they had learned a place response. There were, however, abnormalities in their swimming patterns, and despite having acquired one place response, they did not then acquire new place responses when only the hidden platform training procedure was used. These results demonstrate that place learning can be acquired by rats in which the hippocampus proper is removed. Contrasts between conditions in which hippocampal rats acquire a place response and conditions in which they fail suggests that the hippocampus may serve as an on line system for monitoring movement and integrating movement paths.}

      \field{abstract}{The hippocampal memory system, consisting of the hippocampal formation and the adjacent parahippocampal region, is known to play an important role in learning and memory processes. In recent years, evidence from a variety of experimental approaches indicates that each of the constituting fields of the hippocampal memory system may serve functionally different, yet complementary roles. Understanding the anatomical organization of cortico-parahippocampal-hippocampal connectivity may lead to a further understanding of these potential functional differences. In the present paper we present the two main conclusions of experiments in which we studied the anatomical organization of the hippocampal memory system of the rat in detail, with a focus on the pivotal position of the entorhinal cortex. We first conclude that the simple traditional view of the entorhinal cortex as simply the input and output structure of the hippocampal formation needs to be modified. Second, our data indicate the existence of two parallel pathways through the hippocampal memory system, arising from the perirhinal and postrhinal cortex. These two parallel pathways may be involved in separately processing functionally different types of sensory information. This second proposition will be subsequently evaluated on the basis of series of electrophysiological studies we carried out in rats and some preliminary functional brain imaging studies in humans.}

      \field{abstract}{To examine whether the hippocampus is required for memory for unique experiences independent of their spatial or temporal context, the authors devised a novel task that requires rats to remember odor-reward associations formed within a single training trial. Unlike previous tests of 1-trial memory, in this task new associations with otherwise familiar stimuli must be formed, and accurate judgments cannot be based on relative familiarity or recency of the stimuli. The authors show that intact rats performed well on this novel test of event memory. Furthermore, rats with lesions of the hippocampus showed no impairments, even over long retention intervals. These data suggest that the hippocampus is not required for event-specific stimulus-reward associations and that other brain structures mediate this aspect of episodic memory.}
